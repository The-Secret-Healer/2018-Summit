[0:00:00] Welcome to the Beyond The Essential Oil Recipe Summit I'm The Secret Healer. And if you're watching on Facebook Live, get ready to like and share because I am joined by the lovely Salvatore Battaglia. Hello my lovely Ah, hello
[0:00:20] Elizabeth. Thank you very much. How are you? Oh, really thank you. Here in beautiful Brisbane, Australia. Yes. Evening there. Morning. Very dismal morning here, I have to say. So we can see the time differences in a big way
[0:00:40] today. Okay. Yes. And this is a tremendous moment for me 'cause you've been on my bucket list to learn from for a very long time. So I'm very excited about today. Oh, I dunno if you're gonna learn anything
[0:01:00] from me, but thank you very much. Oh, where is this? That humility is misplaced, but if there is anybody who doesn't know who you are, can you fill us in? Tell us a little bit about your background. Okay.
[0:01:20] I'm where do I start? I'll start with the present. I've just published a third edition of the Complete Guide to Aromatherapy. It started, the whole project started off back in the late eighties actually. Now. Wow. It started off
[0:01:40] as a set of notes that I was using when I started to teach aromatherapy here in Brisbane. We had one of the first aromatherapy courses that we were offering here in Brisbane at the time. And the students really
[0:02:00] liked these notes. And then. They were asking if we, they could photocopy the notes to give to students at other colleges because they showed their friends who were studying at other colleges said, hold on here. And then one
[0:02:20] student gave me the idea of saying, so these notes are fantastic. Why don't you put them together as a book? And so now more than 20 years on the Complete Guide to Aromatherapy, it's a very honor and it's
[0:02:40] a privilege that the book is being used all around the world as a textbook. I think we've sold well over 120,000 copies thus far. It's translated into Japanese and Korean. So yeah, it's a real honor. Beautiful and well
[0:03:00] deserved, I have to say very well deserved that you've achieved that. Yeah. So there might be surprise amongst people who are tuning in, they've not heard you speak before because your name doesn't sound Australian. Sal, your name come
[0:03:20] from. I do have a beautiful Italian heritage. I was born here in Australia, so I am what Aussies would call like a bit of a skip. Yeah. People from an Italian background we call Skippy. But I was born
[0:03:40] here in Australia, but both my parents are from Italy. They came over to Australia in the 1950s. My wife Carol and she decided that we should have a bit of A-A-D-N-A ancestry check. Oh, did you? And that came
[0:04:00] back very interesting. Both my parents are from Sicily. And I don't know the mafia. I'll be nicer to you from now on. I was always worried when, if you Google my name, please disregard. There are two other Satory
[0:04:20] batts and they are not related to me in any way. So just look for Salvato Batt. Oh, okay. Be aroma therapist. Don't look for Salvato Bat VI Boxer or Salvato Bat. Who's by the way, in jail. I think
[0:04:40] at the moment, somewhere in Italy and another Salva bat in New York who also ended up in jail at me. They kneecap. You are so being treated with a lot more respect from right now on. So more than
[0:05:00] likely we are related because when we got our DNA testing back. I actually was more than what they considered because it's an island state. They can actually trace the DNA a lot more clearly, and I was identified as
[0:05:20] having more than 55%, like what they call Sicilian. DNA. Wow. But in the midst of that, there was Greek Arabic, there was even a little bit of English. DNA. So because Sicily has been one of these like island
[0:05:40] regions that has been invaded by everybody around. Yes. But it very much in the Moorish wars and things, wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's fascinating. Yeah. I'm sorry. So it's very interesting to look at your Yeah. Your ancestry
[0:06:00] and your past, and it's been quite revealing and quite exciting. Like you just used the word mafia before. Yeah. But people don't realize that the origins of, that, the word mafia is actually an Arabic word because of the
[0:06:20] strong Italian of the influence from the Arabs of the Arabic. Yeah. Now, as Sicily, now. It's like very well known for its citrus fruits. Yeah. And produce some of the finest oils in that southern part of Italy. The
[0:06:40] collab from Calabria. You get the most beautiful bergamo and from Sicily you get the most divine lemon oil. So one other thing I need to disclose is I'm also the founder of a company here in Australia called Perfect
[0:07:00] Ocean. And that's been something. So we specialize in aromatherapy and natural skincare and we just received just recently from producers. We get this most divine organic collabion bergamo oil and this divine Sicilian or Sicilian lemon oil. It is
[0:07:20] so beautiful. Speaks to you on a really different level, doesn't it? Yes. And I decided I can't just call this certified organic lemon oil. I've decided with labeling it certified organic Sicilian lemon oil. Yes, exactly. Pay homage to
[0:07:40] the heritage. Very lovely. Thank you. So I'm gonna let people in on it. Little secret. We haven't planned at all what we were gonna talk about today, but you dangled the carrot Yes. Of a gentleman called Luca Turin,
[0:08:00] did you not? You said I might be interested in and I was very well behaved and didn't look him up, but I know that he's from Lebanon Yeah, I didn't even know that. You'll never beat me. And he
[0:08:20] is very interested in olfaction, correct? Yes. Talk to me about him. He sounds fascinating. Okay. Okay. So I've always, before I introduce Luca Turin in a little bit about his work and his look, if you pick up one
[0:08:40] of his papers, it's full of mathematical equations as well, trying to prove his theory of olfaction, which happens to be quite contrary to the traditional understanding of olfaction, which everybody thinks is what they call lock and key, which
[0:09:00] is basically structural looking at the molecule. So you have your olfactory neurons and you actually have this receptor and the right molecule odor molecule comes along, and if it's the right shape, bang, you get this lock and see
[0:09:20] effect, and that then sends the message to the actual olfactory bulb and triggers off the hole. Factory impulses. Yeah. Luca Turin. Now, I think I may get the story wrong because it's been a while since I read The
[0:09:40] Emperor of Scent. I will Give You, which is a wonderful book that I would highly recommend because it gives you a little bit of a autobiography on his, on, on his work. And it's ri it's written in a
[0:10:00] way that we can understand as well. I just want to make sure I get the author of the Emperor of Scent. Oh, it's not Oh, its not him? Its somebody different? No it's, I think it's was it Richard
[0:10:20] or Raymond Bur the Emperor of Scent Now that was published back in 2002. Now, so what Luca basically is saying is olfaction is based on vibration now. A lot has changed since 2002. And look, he, by no means
[0:10:40] was he the first person to suggest that olfaction is vibration. This goes right back to the 1930s where scientists suggested that maybe olfaction is based on the molecular vibrations. So were they saying? Is he treating it like a
[0:11:00] wavelength then? What he's basically saying is it goes, and I don't want to jump into the G-protein coupled receptors yet, but we are all, many of us may be familiar with these G protein coupled receptors. But he's suggesting
[0:11:20] that they behave like like a spectroscope where you have, you need an emission of electrons that and. These G-protein coupled receptors are actually measuring the vibration, the free of the molecules, not the actual shape of the molecules. And
[0:11:40] what I became interested in this, and this is totally not, and I'm sure Luca Turin wouldn't be too happy with this, is this is because I'm sure he's trying to look at it from a very academic, scientific basis.
[0:12:00] And there is this argument, by the way, is still continuing. The most recent paper was published in 2017 by Luca Turin and his colleagues providing more evidence that this vibrational model does work. But the point is, if it
[0:12:20] was shape, its smell was based on shape, then it wouldn't be called a theory. But both are still called theories. Yeah. So there's still so much we don't understand about olfaction. Oh, absolutely. Oh absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And I've
[0:12:40] been teaching aromatherapy for over 20 years and it's been very interesting that when it comes to olfaction, it's something that gets skimmed over. And it's not surprising because I've always said that understanding smell, it's the final frontier. Yeah.
[0:13:00] Of science. Yeah. And I remember in some, I don't forget when it was in, sometime in the late nineties, I remember saying, yeah, I'm gonna do a science degree. Here I was running my own aromatherapy school, got nothing
[0:13:20] else to do. Running my, running, my, running my own. I had a busy practice at the time running a practice, and I decided I wanted to do a science degree. And of course I wanted to do phy, a
[0:13:40] science degree in physiology. And I think I attended about two weeks of lectures. And I said, I just don't have the time because I. On the first day, the dean of the school, did an introductory speak speech and
[0:14:00] he said, you are getting into a very exciting field, physiology, you could see people go, oh yeah. But anyway, he then started talking about, or faction new the brains brain, you know how the brain works and neurosciences now
[0:14:20] turned out, this was back in the late nineties, and it's like the area where people are doing the most research now. Oh yeah, definitely. Yeah. Yeah. And when it comes to smell and the understanding of smell, why do
[0:14:40] we still refer to these. As theories, and I want be in my, when I teach aromatherapy, of course I teach the chemistry of the essential oils. We look at the pharmacology, but one thing that did draw me to
[0:15:00] aromatherapy was my background before I studied aromatherapy. And what really got me into the whole complementary medicine field was traditional Chinese medicine. And traditional Chinese medicine is about and Q, it's understanding energy. So I'd always related my knowledge
[0:15:20] of TCM to Q and to energy. And therefore, when I think of essential oils, I try to relate to them in terms of qi, what effect do they have on our energy. And then I said okay, when we
[0:15:40] start talking about energetic medicine, when vibrational medicine, of course, we try to have an underlying scientific basis for it. And there's a lot of people doing some amazing work in this area. And I thought hold on. We've got,
[0:16:00] we've got people, doing all this interesting work. I've met some really interesting people in my time that have used curling photography equipment and what they call the GDV gas discharge voltage. And hopefully I can get one of my
[0:16:20] PowerPoint presentations up to show everybody how the this GDV gas discharge visual visualization works. So it got me thinking essential oils are so rich in energy. We know that, don't we? And how do we know they have so
[0:16:40] much energy? You can smell them. The, these molecules don't want to sit in the bottom of the bottle. They just want to, burst. They wanna burst out of the bottle. And there seems to be so much emphasis now,
[0:17:00] and maybe it's coming from this western medical paradigm. We are trying so hard to be accepted. Yeah. By the, by what you know, by the Western medical framework, that the focus seems to be all on the chemistry of
[0:17:20] the essential oils. But yet there's been, I forget the name. Hold on. I've just got some notes. Can I refer to my Yes, definitely. For example, I just read a book and it's called the, it was published in
[0:17:40] 2012 and it's the book is called End of Illness, and it was by Dr. August. And he's a, from America, a very wellknown, world renowned oncologist. And you know what? In his introductory chapters, he goes, you know what,
[0:18:00] maybe we've got it all wrong. This whole, the whole western paradigm. Because what we do is we want to A, we want to identify what we believe is the cause of the disease, and then we usually want to
[0:18:20] destroy that organism that we believe is responsible for the disease. We then want to cut out any part of the body that has been damaged or diseased, obviously. As an oncologist, I can understand where he is coming from,
[0:18:40] but he's going, Hey, but what about some of these other more traditional systems? And he refers to Ayurveda and he says, Ayurveda, for example, is all about restoring the harmony of the body of the various forces that influence
[0:19:00] the body. And so it's very interesting that as an oncologist, he's actually taken a small back to a more holistic approach of healing. Mind you, he doesn't talk about that in his book, but it's a very interesting introduction
[0:19:20] that he introduces us to. I think there's a trend there isn't there with people saying okay, if we step back a little bit and look at how things were done in the past. We learn from the past a
[0:19:40] little bit now. Yeah. And I do believe that essential oils take us right back to the past now. I'll get back, we will get back to Luca Turin soon. That's alright. I'm enjoying this. Carry on. Yeah, so sorry.
[0:20:00] Please be patient with this, but what I don't think I wanna get back to my original discussion. It's very interesting that the way essential oils and aromatherapy is being used today as a standalone therapy. Having my background having
[0:20:20] come from, before I actually came into aromatherapy, I had training in naturopathy, I have qualifications in naturopathy and also in traditional Chinese medicine in acupuncture. And so I came to aromatherapy from a different perspective and I came to
[0:20:40] aromatherapy going, oh my God. Okay. So whe wherever I was prescribing herbal medicine. People go, do I really have to take these tincture? So they taste dreadful. So you do your best to mask their flavor, mask the taste,
[0:21:00] using licorice extract or some other, that wouldn't help. Yes. Or I know that my clients would love acupuncture treatment because that was, my specialty at the time before I got into aromatherapy. But yeah, the idea of being, treated
[0:21:20] as a pin cushion just didn't appeal to people. I still think acupuncture's amazing. They, as I started to introduce the essential oils I just got this overwhelming response and reaction and then I started to see some incredible transformations
[0:21:40] and I just realized, and it was a beautiful quote and. It was this beautiful quote that it was one of the first books that I ever read, and it was a little Blue book, physician Healed Thyself by Dr.
[0:22:00] Bark. Yep. And so this I think, was written in the 1930s. And I want to, and whatever class, I often read this out to my students. And I think this underpins everything we should always do as therapists, no
[0:22:20] matter what modality we are using. And I've actually just realized what I had done as I'd taken snippets and put them together to create this beautiful phrase. But these are all, Dr. Bark's works from physician heal thyself, as
[0:22:40] long as our souls and personalities are in harmony. All is joy and peace, happiness and health. It is when our personalities are led astray from the path laid down by the soul, either by our worldly desires or the
[0:23:00] persuasion of others that conflict arises. This conflict is the root cause of disease and unhappiness. I absolutely agree. 1000000% with that isn't that amazing. Just beautiful. And they, he then goes on to say, disease in essence is the
[0:23:20] result of conflict between the soul and the mind. And guess what? When I started to use essential oils and introduce them to my practice, and I found that. I was getting this, I was almost getting similar results to
[0:23:40] my acupuncture and herbal medicine using essential oils, but the transformation was often much quicker. And here people were just even smelling the oil. So it wasn't even just, it wasn't even the traditional aromatherapy massage techniques that I was
[0:24:00] using. And I trained with, world renowned mad michelia. And the technique is such a beautiful, powerful technique. And I'd love to talk about that because then it all links in to what we are now understanding about the autonomic
[0:24:20] nervous system and the actual massage working on the nerve ganglia along the back. Sorry, I'm going all over the place here, but doesn't matter. It all links in because this is all going to link in because some of
[0:24:40] the latest research now there is a what was his, what's his name? David Kennedy, who's written this amazing book called Plants and the Human Brain. Oh my goodness. I have bought this book on your recommendation. Cost me an
[0:25:00] arm and the leg, but I am. It's Blum and expensive. That book is, but wow. I am loving it, Sal. It's fascinating. Okay. Okay. And basically, and you get the gist of what he's actually saying. Haven't you, in
[0:25:20] that book, he actually says that many of, and I'm just got, I'm just gonna paraphrase something here. Many of the neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and hormones that are integral to the functioning of our own central nervous system are in fact
[0:25:40] the chemical products of metabolic processes that existed in plants and animals over a billion years ago, because we all came from the one path genetic path. And then he talks about those plant chemicals, which are the most sign,
[0:26:00] have the most significant influence. He talks about the alkaloids, which more if you are in herbal med into herbal medicine, you'd understand the ethanols and then the terpenes. Of course this takes into account the essential oils as well.
[0:26:20] And so he then he comes up with two hypotheses and one hypothesis is to do with, okay, is it because insects, because we have a similar central nervous system to insects and because the, we understand the relationship that
[0:26:40] insects still have with the plants, and this is why. Insects are attracted to, to the various flowers and the Yeah. And and so on. Whether it be bees, moths, flies, all the insects are attracted. So it's a way
[0:27:00] of plants to communicate. Have we forgotten? Those original connections with the plants? I doubt it very much because if we have a look at most traditional indigenous practices. Plants still play a very important role, especially in their spiritual
[0:27:20] practices. Yeah, because it heightens, and this is what Professor David Kennedy talks about in plants in the human brain. And he talks about the free, the he talks about even caffeine, like being an al alkaloid and how we've
[0:27:40] become addicted to that. But we've actually modified the caffeine molecule to the way that it would've been traditionally used. But of course he spends a lot of time then talking about the essential oil bearing plants. And he's most
[0:28:00] interested in all the essential oil bearing pants from the Lae family, like the Sages and the Rosemarys. 'cause he is very interested in how he believes that they mimic. Many of the neurotransmitters, and this is why we've traditionally
[0:28:20] known these essential oils to be cephalic and have an incredible effect on the mind. He's now uncovering why they could work and he's suggesting that more research should be done in this area to find treatments for dementia and
[0:28:40] Alzheimer's disease. Because the tradition, the drugs that are being used at the moment just aren't working. No. No. And what, actually, I can extend on that a little bit. Something that came up in Dr. Florian Birkmeyer's talk. He
[0:29:00] did, he knocked me off my chair actually, because he was saying that plants also have dopamine. So they have the same, they actually contain the same neurotransmitters as we do, and I didn't know that they, yeah. Yeah. That's
[0:29:20] fascinating to me. Yeah, so they do contain the similar neurotransmitters. So once again, we do understand that. In most cases, the way that we, like, when you look at the, that comm, that new the communication between the neurons
[0:29:40] there is this, and it has always been their whole pharmacology industry is built around molecular shape. And up to now the drug industry, the perfume industry is based on developing molecules or trying to mimic molecule molecules from nature
[0:30:00] by looking at that shape. So along comes, I thought I'd get back to Luca Turin eventually long one Day is working in his LA laboratory, and I think at that time, oh God, don't, yeah, he, I think, I
[0:30:20] dunno if he was working in the perfume laboratory, he's looking at two different molecules. Yeah. Two totally different molecules, but they have the same smell. Ah. And he said, but hold on. But if everybody says that smell is
[0:30:40] shape, why do they have a different same Same molecule? Yeah. Why do they have the same smell, but they're different shape? So he decided to plug them into a spectrometer to look, measure their molecular vibration and alas, similar
[0:31:00] molecular vibrations. Okay. So that led him to believe, he did his research and realized there was a chap called Dyson and a chap before that called that had written about this, and he said, could there be a vibrational
[0:31:20] basis for smell? Now if it turns out to be correct, it's. Turn the entire pharmaceutical industry on its head because we need to look potentially at new ways of developing drugs, which may be more molecular vibrational based. Now,
[0:31:40] this is gonna be too hard, I was going to say, how on earth would you begin to do that? You would have to use a natural molecule, wouldn't you? Not well I suppose it's very interesting because I wanna
[0:32:00] talk about the olfactory receptors, and there was one study, and this one really blew me away that we can have these olfactory neurons that I, what they call e. Located. You've heard of that Elizabeth found? No. Tell me
[0:32:20] what that means. Were they're found in other parts of the body. In other parts of the body. Like endometriosis isn't in the womb? Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Okay. They don't just exist in the, off in the nose, but they
[0:32:40] don't see, they don't, they only seem to appear when the body, I like this term that Dr. AGAs uses when the body is cancering, when it's when cancer is developing in an area. Wow. How interesting is that? Now,
[0:33:00] why do these olfactory neurons appear now, this is very recent study. This has only been in the last eight years or so that they've identified this. Now, the inter, it was just that I was reading one particular paper
[0:33:20] and they were talking about. Olfactory receptors on the skin where they were car active carcinomas. So these were on the, these were on the skin. Now what they found was that they, the authors were doing research and they
[0:33:40] decided to use a, now, and this is where it froze the cat among the pigeons, they were using synthetic sandalwood molecules that gives a sandal law, or I forget what, a, a synthetic sandal law or something like that.
[0:34:00] Okay. Okay. I wouldn't have been using in a synthetic sandalwood, odorant. And then I was reading the paper and it says, oh, because pure sandalwood essential oil is so expensive. So we decided to use a synthetic sandalwood odorant.
[0:34:20] Now, it's very interesting that the, these all factory receptors. Were the responded to this sandalwood molecules that were being used in this test. Now my, but mind you, at this stage, most of this work is still at a
[0:34:40] very preliminary stage. And so it was all in vitro work. Okay. So they were the, they had the tissue in like in, yeah. So it wasn't on the person, but of course if you are, I like to say
[0:35:00] okay, where's this research gonna take us? So I like to make a big leap of faith and say potentially this is why we've always used sandalwood oil on this skin topically on this skin, and this is why it
[0:35:20] is so good as for wound healing. So anyway, what the paper was suggesting is these olfactory receptors activate the wound healing process. When they are, when they're, that they're activated by sandalwood, these synthetic, these sandalwood molecules and it
[0:35:40] activated the wound healing process. So there is so much that we still don't understand about these olfactory receptors. And I think of course there is something potentially at a pharmacological level happening, but I think underpinning that pharmacological mechanism,
[0:36:00] I believe, I'd like to believe that there is this vibrational mechanism because we now understand, and I believe these olfactory receptors are detecting these molecular vibrations. And hence, I like to use this to support my argument when I'm
[0:36:20] talking about subtle aromatherapy or more energetic. Approach to aromatherapy. I just wanna go back to something you said right at the beginning, Sal something you said right at the beginning of your talk about these gcps and this ligand
[0:36:40] and receptor, and you were saying the odorant seemed to act more like a volume switch. Did I hear that right? Was I talking about my computer? No, sorry. No. Okay. Look, there's still a big mystery around this. I
[0:37:00] think what they actually, now, I think the new term that they're actually using, that they're not. Since then there's been there's been this new approach, which is suggesting that maybe the olfactory neurons just loosely hold. They wiggle, don't
[0:37:20] they? Rigg? Because see, molecules are rigging all the time. So how on earth is it actually, you're not going get this perfect lock and key. No, exactly No, exactly right.. And there, there was something in that volume switch
[0:37:40] that, that tapped a brain. And people who read my books will already know what I'm going to ask because Okay. Yeah. So I'm thinking about the endocannabinoid system, right? Okay. Yes. Is what, which is what the cannabis medicines.
[0:38:00] Yes. Tapping to right. They too were our volume switches for our receptors. Yes. So now it's very interesting to me that we are talking about the fact that there would be odorants on the skin trigger healing for sort
[0:38:20] of cancerous problems. Because that would be the CB one receptor would do that because, so they, so what the this is just, this is just very quick hypothesis and there's no scientific rounding at all just before anybody decides
[0:38:40] to quote it because it's just me thinking out loud. But I love this thinking that aloud. Exactly. So so the CB one receptor modulates hunger and pain and cognition and memory and itching and nausea. The CB two receptor
[0:39:00] modulates immunity pain, and. Inflammation. So actually probably it's a CB two receptor if it is one of those receptors. But they too are, they switch things up and switch things down. That's what they do. They say send more
[0:39:20] of that neurotransmitter or less. So it's very interesting that there's, yeah. I do think CB two receptor, if it's gonna be one of them. That it's going there's cancer and then it's found a way to switch a volume
[0:39:40] on. That's really interesting. Yeah, because, yeah, so because all of, because they will not be found in normal healthy tissue and not, and they have found the different and they've actually named them and numbered them. They give them
[0:40:00] like, individual, a numbering system. Every time they find one of these new olfactory re receptors. So they give them A name and Yeah, that's right. Yeah, a particular number and so on. And they have found them in the
[0:40:20] intestines, they found them on the pancreas, they found them on the ovaries and that the body expresses them wherever it is. Cancering. I just find that really fascinating. It really is. And maybe there is something to say. I
[0:40:40] would dare not suggest that essential oils can almost. You know that can be responsible because cancer is such a complex disease. There are many factors. Correct. But I do think that essential oils perhaps can play a very important
[0:41:00] role in any holistic treatment strategy, not just at a pharmacological level, but also may be because I at this more, at this more subtle level 'cause and that I keep getting drawn back to what Dr. Edward Bark had
[0:41:20] said. But I just wanna also talk about what Luca Turin and this is a well-known fact, it's not just Luca Turin, it says that, the same in the nose, for example, the same olf factories receptor can detect different
[0:41:40] odor molecules. So it's quite complex, the physiology. Because we have so few olfactory receptors. I think there's there's, they're in their thousands, but yet we can detect tens of thousands of different particular odor odors. And so each receptor
[0:42:00] is probably responsible for detecting more than one type of odorant. How does it do that? Because it can measure, because perhaps as Turin is suggesting, it can measure the vibrations. Now they have, they've been able to confirm this.
[0:42:20] With insects, with a particular species of fly that they always seem to be using. That's got to be oph. Yes. That, that they always use particular species of fly and they've been able to confirm and prove. And what
[0:42:40] they do is because I think they just make, I think they're using I forget what it is. They will put, they will switch one of the hydrogen molecules so it becomes like a heavy, they put an extra proton
[0:43:00] or n neutron, they put it extra neutron in the hydrogen and they switch it so it changes. The shape is still the same, exactly the same shape, but it changes the frequency, the vibration of that particular molecule. And
[0:43:20] so they have done this many times and proven that this particular fly can detect the difference. Between these two different molecules that now have a different molecular vibration. That's very fascinating. And I think the central nervous system is
[0:43:40] fairly similar to that of humans. And for that reason, and this is exactly what Professor, professor Kennedy is constantly talking about with his what in his book that he refers to. Very interesting. So if we take that piece
[0:44:00] of information and then we go make a step into actual subtle aromatherapy, how does that impact our understanding of subtle aromatherapy, do you think? I think it actually, all of a sudden, I, and I think this is going
[0:44:20] to happen sooner than later, it's going to give us a much more scientific basis for subtle aromatherapy. I dare say that perhaps it's going to take us into uncharted territories because we are, and this was in a perfumer
[0:44:40] and flavorist journal where the title of the paper was called Sesqui Terpenoids, the Spiritual Molecules. Oh, you can see where this you read even more than I do, and that's saying something and you find seriously good shit. I
[0:45:00] need to read that so you can see where this is actually taking us. Yeah I, and I've I, and I would hate to think that our own spiritual connection that we make with the world, with ourselves is going
[0:45:20] to simply come down to this. A scientific molecular basis. Yeah. But I think it's going to open up the doors to having a better understanding of why certain spiritual practices have developed over millennia. And guess what is a
[0:45:40] common feature of all these spiritual practices? Scent. Yeah. Man, which culture you will find that scent is used. Yeah. And I must admit I settled down with that Plants and the Human Mind book and I, I only got
[0:46:00] a couple of pages read in amongst all the work I've got, but I did fascinate me he got right to the crux of the issue because he was saying that. And you see these in these spiritual practices. Yes.
[0:46:20] And there are entheogens and so yes, that's, and then I did, and I did think, actually, why would it be so much more difficult to believe that cannabis could get you connected to the Godhead than Rose attaching you
[0:46:40] to, to the vibration of a si to, to isis. That's conditioning, that's not a leap of faith, is it? Yeah. I thought it's very interesting, clever how he got there so fast. Yes, exactly. So yeah, he often refers
[0:47:00] to that. I'm often, and this is the challenge for aromatherapy, isn't it? Because essential oils, we know we do understand how they work. And we've tended to use, and we don't wanna discuss the chemistry of essential oils from
[0:47:20] a pharmacological basis, but we understand how they work that way. We, we use them in everyday perfumery. And it's really interesting. I will love to mention some of the people that I admire, and there were many people that
[0:47:40] I admire in the aromatherapy industry, but I just love the work of Valerie and Word, and so I and the fragrant mind, and I just think that's amazing. But guess what, Valerie wasn't the first one to introduce that
[0:48:00] concept of scent and personality. That goes back to the ancient Greeks, and she acknowledges that in her book. But the perfume industry has long been doing this as well, linking certain personality types to scent. And once again. No
[0:48:20] matter whether we are, looking at it from a more spiritual perspective, personality perspective, what was the word that Dr. Bark used? Our personality or our soul is led off the path. And so this is where I introduce the
[0:48:40] personality of the essential oils as well. And what I did, this is getting off the track, but what I decided to do is there any way that I can quantify this? And so I chose one of the personality
[0:49:00] profiling test, and psychologists don't like these personality tests. They just say personality is too vague. And, it really does. And I tend to, I think they have. A. A purpose. But pro, I think what psychologists have a problem
[0:49:20] is with, they don't like it when these personality tests pigeonhole you. Yeah. So are we talking Psychometric profiling? So it says that you we're talking Myers Briggs. My and i. And I used the Myers-Briggs and I've introduced that
[0:49:40] in the third edition. 'cause I find it a very useful tool, but that's all we can use it as. But I don't want somebody to say, oh, I'm introvert so I'm only gonna like essential oils that are introvert
[0:50:00] or I'm extrovert. Because I think that's a misunderstanding. There are times. But we feel that we want to be more introverted. There are times that we want to be more extroverted. I'll be very honest, I've been speaking for
[0:50:20] more than 30 years in front of students, in front of large audiences, and I have never felt like an introvert and so nervous as speaking here tonight. Because why? Because for me, my communication relies on being able to
[0:50:40] look at the reci you're doing wonderfully. What was I talking about? By time from my stage in my rose, we were talking about how people have predominant personality profiles and they change and merge. Yeah. All for introverted oils
[0:51:00] or all for extroverted oil. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, so yeah, so it, it was coming back to the, coming back to the essential oils, so that relies on scent, but how do we even make sense of how a particular
[0:51:20] smell, we can measure it, but the mechanisms to understand how it works. Is still beyond us. And the science, I simply say, sometimes the science is slowly catching up to aromatherapy, to helping us to understand because aroma, that's,
[0:51:40] I lost my track. Reverse engineer. Yeah. So I wanted to talk about, so aromatherapy works on so many different levels, and so because it works on so many levels, it's like this wild beast that cannot be tamed. Like
[0:52:00] many other holistic practices have been tamed and like pigeonholed acupuncture. You have now a set. Sequence of points that you need to use for certain conditions. Yeah, for herb, for herbal medicine, it's very clearly based, it's no different.
[0:52:20] It fits in nicely to the pharmacological model, but aromatherapy doesn't fit into one unique model. That's what makes aromatherapy extremely challenging. And this actually it's a bit disappointing that I think this is not the definition being used anymore
[0:52:40] by the National Center of Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and this is out of American. I don't even know if it's called that anymore, but it's the one that I like to refer to because this is from 2002, and
[0:53:00] I know that they have changed the different categories for complementary medicines. Now, these were the five categories that they said all complementaries fit into. One is the alternative medicine based. Systems. So we're talking Ayurveda or Chinese medicine. One
[0:53:20] is the mind body interventions. Three is biological based therapies, four is the manipulative and body based therapies. And then fifth one is the energy therapies good. Could actually go into any of those, couldn't it? Exactly what I'm saying.
[0:53:40] Exactly. And that's why it's such a beautiful discipline. 'cause it can be, that's what people will see from this summit that how many different way ways you can use the modality. Yes, exactly. And so we have a difficult
[0:54:00] time. To put aromatherapy into any context. I tend to agree, and this was a comment that Kurt Schnaubelt back in 1999. It's a practice without a theory. It's just, it's disjointed. It's all over the place, but I think
[0:54:20] that's what makes it very exciting magic. Yeah. And then we had somebody in Australia, and I love, her pH PhD is available online. It's like the professionalization of aromatherapy. We had Janelle sheen do a PhD on how can
[0:54:40] aromatherapy be professionalized? Because in Australia we have seen, and I think this is happening around the world, therapies like. Acupuncture in Chinese medicine get degree status. Yeah. Naturopathy getting degree status. But that has not happened to aromatherapy. Why
[0:55:00] has that, why hasn't that happened to aromatherapy? Janelle Sheen had proposed that one, and she didn't say this was the only, she just said one of the pathways to help aromatherapy become, to gain a more professional status would
[0:55:20] be to embed it within a nursing framework. Nursing qualification. Yeah. And you know what? That makes sense, but it's not pathway. And she acknowledges that. Now, one of the pathways I would've proposed as well, and I think she
[0:55:40] does mention this, is that it could be embedded within a naturopathy. Because when you are seeing a client. While I was saying, going back to what I said, how I got involved in aromatherapy of course it isn't just
[0:56:00] the essential oils, it is the counseling. There's lifestyle advice, there's nutritional advice. Sometimes there may need to be intervention with herbal remedies as well. That compliment, and this is my concern is with aromatherapy, there is still too much
[0:56:20] reading something about a herb, but then you see frankincense or rosemary and we don't differentiate. Is this the herb or is this the oil? This is happen too often and I think it's comes about from some of the
[0:56:40] earlier French books, but like from Dr. Jean. But he acknowledged that. The oils because the oils are part of the herb and he does. But people have forgotten that. No. Sometimes he's talking about the oils, but sometimes he's
[0:57:00] actually talking about the whole herbal extract and we tend to have gotten confused. You're right. And I've done, I've done that in the past. There's a, an old website that I was in charge of a very long time
[0:57:20] ago with one of the few pages about damiana essential oils. Yes. So it's very little written about it. I dunno anything about it. Please tell me. Oh, it's a fantastic aphrodisiac oil. And but one of the contraindications that
[0:57:40] I've listed on there is that it shouldn't be used if you've got diabetes. And the only way that I could get to that was through the herbal medicine because there's nothing written to or anything like that. But actually
[0:58:00] now I have no access to the to the website to be able to put it right. But actually we know now from research that's gone into the oil that actually constituent that would affect the pancreas. Not that. Yeah.
[0:58:20] Okay. But the herb, maybe it was the herbal extract. Herbal extract, yeah. Yes. The herbal extract. Yes. Okay. Yes. And we do know that the herb has traditionally had those correct, Properties as well. Yeah. Which comes back to
[0:58:40] the way in which we come, comes back to the way, when I look at the way essential oils are used, I tend to look at them energetically. I tend to look at them more from the, I have, having
[0:59:00] my background being TCMI tend to use it more from a TCM framework. So I will either use the five elements, or I will use, even when I'm looking at the client, I will look at the external factors, the
[0:59:20] internal factors that often the catalyst for disharmony disease occurring. And that could be like the internal factors are usually the emotions. For example, the external factors are the seasonal changes or the external forces, the wind, the heat, the
[0:59:40] coal, the dam that are like the catalyst when they go outta balance. But what these modalities identify and to that they link personalities, they link. So each of the elements, each of the dosha has certain characteristics. Yeah. And
[1:00:00] I think that certain illnesses develop a kind of emotional phenotype as well, don't they? And once you put it into this context Exactly, it makes a lot more sense why somebody who is, who ha has a strong wood
[1:00:20] element is probably more re more going to ha be related to a ner have a nervous disposition or a lot of anger issues, for example. Or somebody for very strong fire constitution is going to be more prone to
[1:00:40] psychological depression, for example. Or somebody with a earth disposition Earth, strong earth element influence is going to be more prone to a worrying disposition. Sure. So Exactly. What I would like to see is that maybe because each of
[1:01:00] these elements, each of the dashes we know we are attracted to certain. Smells, certain scents. So I and kind. I didn't know that. I didn't know I didn't know that Tell me more about that. I we all do
[1:01:20] this. We say these are like the fire, these are the oils, which those with the strong fire constitution are going to be more drawn towards. These are the oils, that somebody for more wood constitution will be more drawn
[1:01:40] to. Now why is this so from that we can match the personality type. But maybe one day when we have a better understanding of the vibrational theory of olfaction or, but sorry, the term that I was wanting to
[1:02:00] refer to is the swipe card model is being used now the nuts. And you know what? Cannot, can it not be possible? And more than likely, it is possible that scent is based on both the structure of the
[1:02:20] molecule and the vibration of the aroma molecule are both important. Yeah, I definitely think that's the case. When you one is right and the other is wrong. No, exactly. And when you are looking at how physiology works, in
[1:02:40] fact I'll use this actual slide in my presentation about pain. When you see how the body's firing in so many different ways, you've got molecules going that way across the top, like a motorway intersection. There's so many things
[1:03:00] going on. Why would it be an either or nothing else in the bodies like that. Exactly. Exactly. And just to give you an idea, this came from one of the most recent papers that was refuting Luca Turin's work.
[1:03:20] And I think it was published as in 1917. And it concludes with a comment like this. The fact is that it is still not possible to predict the performance of odor molecules using shape or vibration alone. So we
[1:03:40] are still no better off something else out there, because I think it was only in 1994 that we, that two scientists got the a Nobel Prize for understanding, linking these G-protein coupled receptors and olfactory you factories, neurons, and
[1:04:00] so on. And understanding the basis, having this basis for scent. Yeah, exactly right. For smell. Yeah. It's recent phenomen, this understanding that we have. So how do you see that tapping into the aura and chakras then? Obviously this
[1:04:20] is just completely hypothesis, but how do you see that affecting the aura and chakras when you smell a smell? Ah. Now I think we would have to a totally a new, we would have to have an another discussion
[1:04:40] about chakras. On their own. Yeah. Okay. But what is the one thing that we talk about when we talk about auras and chakras? We talk about energy. Yep. And energy is vibration. Energy is frequency. And it's been able
[1:05:00] to measure it's understanding. I think maybe one day we will have an understanding of the disease, different diseases, and I'm sure people are doing research. Having a different vibration, having a different energy, and it's about tapping in matching
[1:05:20] the frequency of the, or the energy of the essential oils with that disease. Yeah. Don't you think? Yeah. And so this is where, and so I find that the auras and the chakras are just another model. Now we
[1:05:40] can just debate, I won't say the shady origins of chakras. I think it's a very illuminating and very interesting path that the chakras have taken. But everything that we tend to talk about chakras nowadays is more of a
[1:06:00] western construct rather than the traditional Eastern tantric Indian original. Construct of what chakras are. And but I think that Western construct, a lot of it has been, it was through the philosophical society at the beginning of the 20th
[1:06:20] century and the late 19th century that the interpretations of this traditional Indian text, tantrics text were made. And slowly over the last hundred years, you could say what we know of chakras have been developed. And I think what
[1:06:40] has developed is quite a beautiful construct. Yeah. It's the realm of Pinterest now, but it is, but it's very beautiful medicine. It helps us to understand perhaps that and this is where the traditional origins of the chakras probably
[1:07:00] did develop because it's about raising and elevating our level of consciousness. And basically. And I would hate to think that it's not necessary. The whole idea that it's a step-by-step process is once again, a western construct, because our
[1:07:20] chakras can be all over the place. Yeah. But these energy centers are there for a reason. Now when we have a look at the relationship and perhaps we can understand because the early text relating to chakras didn't relate
[1:07:40] to chakras, to different nerve plexus, for example. Or different endocrine glands. But all the new, all the more recent texts, talk about endocrine glands associated with each chakra in different nerve places associated with the chakras. Now these are
[1:08:00] areas which are highly con concentrated with specialized neurons. Correct? And this goes back to once again to Kennedy's book plants in the human brain because he talks about acetylcholine esterase inhibitors and he talks about the role of essential
[1:08:20] oils and the nerve plexus in particular a very re a very dense in these neurons that rely on acetylcholine. Yeah, because and also I think that it's fair to say if you go to Candice Pert's - Dr Candice
[1:08:40] Pert Candice, yes. They work, she says that she or she said that she feels like the, when you have a surge of neuro transmission, that's the actual physical feeling that you the sensation you feel in your body. So
[1:09:00] if you. Following that, then we know that they, their movement creates a feeling in our body. So there's clearly great big concentrations of areas of them. And I can remember in her book, she'd said that as she started
[1:09:20] to locate areas where there were large concentrations of neurotransmitters, you could lay a picture of the chakras over the top. And they were pretty much identical. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So these are very highly activated energy centers. They
[1:09:40] are. 'cause we know that there is a lot of energy transmission occurring here now. A lot of the latest researchers going that essential oils can have such a profound influence on these, particularly on these different energy centers and
[1:10:00] these, any and we are also activate these energy centers and these new, these nerve plexus when we do. I will use the word simple aromatherapy massage. Sure. Yeah. So we tend to activate these nerve plexus when we combine
[1:10:20] the physical acts of the massage by activating these nerve plexus, by using essential oils that can potentially enhance the nerve trans, the nerve transmission. It is not surprising that aromatherapy has such a profound influence on the autonomic nervous
[1:10:40] system. No, and of course on the subtle energy system as well, because they are linked, they're one completely with the subtle body and the nervous system are really one. It's just that our current knowledge or construct of the
[1:11:00] nervous system is still fairly primitive. That's. What I'm hypothesizing, I think as well, that there's, we're in a kind of similar situation really, that when researchers are looking at essential oils for medicines or what have you, they're looking
[1:11:20] at the oil and they're say, or the plant, and they're saying we know that it's good for epilepsy. We want to understand why it's good for epilepsy. And that will help us to elucidate what's going on in the
[1:11:40] physical body, actually help us to understand the human body more. And I think it's the same sort of thing with the vibrational es healing, isn't it? Yes. They're gonna have to do that reverse engineering to understand what's going
[1:12:00] on in our body? That's not about the essential oil at all. It's about what's happening here. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Look I, I do I think. Eventually not one tea, going back to your original discussion is eventually whatever happens,
[1:12:20] we know that this original it's not the original, but the propo that the proposal that Luca Turin made about the vibrational basis for scent is here to stay. I think so, because we know we, he's proven that it,
[1:12:40] this is what happens. But what is going to, I think what is going to, it's going to eventually, we are going to understand that it's a combination of both and that's why they've had to change this new term,
[1:13:00] this white card theory. But I think it's going to potentially revolutionize the way we think of essential oils. Yeah. Interesting. I think because I think we will be able to use the discoveries that are happening now, not just
[1:13:20] to understand it's gonna be a new pharmacological paradigm, but it's also going to help us to understand why the essential oils have such a profound effect on the central nervous system and can be so beneficial for conditions such
[1:13:40] as Alzheimer's. But also it's going to link, so the subtle, the spiritual side is going to become mainstream. Yeah. Eventually as we uncover, and this is why I am fascinated with this work, and I'm keeping up to date.
[1:14:00] You're now comment, commentary. Commentary. Now I'm just worried that we haven't given, but I think that is the title of this whole conference and it's beyond. The, I think you've absolutely delivered. Because if that doesn't tell us why
[1:14:20] we go beyond the essential oil recipe. I have no idea what it does. 'cause it was beautifully elucidated. Yeah. But most of the time when I give classes, there's almost this expectation that people. Get recipes and blends. Do
[1:14:40] not use that word in my present. Okay. So we won't give, we won't give any recipes and blends. I'm joking. I'm only joking because they have their place, don't they? And I think that they definitely have their place,
[1:15:00] especially in like acute medicine with coughs and colds and stuff like that. You've caught a bug, so let's kill call, let's kill a bug. But I think when somebody's got a long-term chronic illness, probably not relating responding to
[1:15:20] the doctor's treatment, then's definitely got its place. And going back to what you were saying about cancer. One of the things that I find absolutely fascinating, and I'm sure that my readers can absolutely recite, recite by memory is
[1:15:40] my fascination with this is that. When the body has high levels of serotonin, which is the mood modulator amongst other things, has about 30 different functions. Yep. When it has high levels of serotonin that affects chemotaxis. Illness markers,
[1:16:00] whether those be tumor necrosis factor, whether they be inflammatory markers they slow down. Yes. So if you are happier and you are calmer Yeah. Then you are really fortifying your body in a big way. And that's in probably
[1:16:20] the most simple term that when the doctor says The best thing you can do is manage your stress. Yeah. Yes, it's absolutely true. And there's no better way to do that than with essential oils. That's awesome. Because the,
[1:16:40] I often mention is when I do one of my presentations and it is to do more with subtle aromatherapy, I start off with this United Nations World Happiness Report. What's that? I like the sound of that. Once again,
[1:17:00] just download, just go online and Google World Happiness Report. Oh, we need that. No matter where you are from just before you download them. It's a P, it's a available as a PDF free. PPDF. They do it every
[1:17:20] year now, I think. But it's very interesting. And each year they pick a certain topic to focus on. One year the focus was on the relationship between happiness and mental health. The most recent World Happiness Report looks at
[1:17:40] displacement of populations, as you can see, and the influence, the effects that has on people's health and wellbeing Often. Each report focus it, it ranks about a hundred. All the countries in the United Nations, about 170 something countries.
[1:18:00] It ranks them and it looks at various measures. And it is not just the GDP, it is like the stand, standard of healthcare provided. It is levels of corruption. There are many different factors, the level of social support
[1:18:20] within the country. And what I do is there's about. I won't say seven. I think there's about six or more factors. I relate each of those to the chakra energy centers. Do you? That's clever. Yes. Yeah. And and
[1:18:40] it gives you, and one is, how much does the society value individuality? The, so that's solar plexus. Yes. And then how, food and shelter for example. How chara and the diaspora, root Chakra . Clever, Sal! I like it.
[1:19:00] Yeah. So how level freedom to express oneself, throat chakra. For E. Exactly. So it's quite, it's I love linking that. Will, that's very clever. Report to each of the chakra energy centers. Beautiful. Do you talk about that in
[1:19:20] your new book? Let's tell people about your new book. 'cause that's a great way. It's time to move on, but can I actually just bend down and reach across? Do it. It just so happens that I have concealed
[1:19:40] about my person! You. Hold on. I've got bookshelf in front of me and behind me. You might have a copy of this book. Keep it still. I do. On. I don't know why, but I love the camera model.
[1:20:00] And you know what, I haven't written about this. I've chosen, you know what the other flower is there? I'm guessing That's the yang. Is it yang? Yes. Yes. Flower. Flower. So now this is the third edition. And you,
[1:20:20] your question was, is that addressed in my, in the Complete Guide to aromatherapy? This is the Complete Guide to Aromatherapy. This book is now going to be, become, has become two books, but I've only written part one. And
[1:20:40] this is just predominantly focused. It's a huge wedge on the essential oil monographs, which are the, I believe are the most detailed, essential monographs that are that, yeah. Ever published. I. Have some introductory, some really wonderful introductory chapters.
[1:21:00] When I started writing the second, the third edition, I thought, oh yeah, there are gonna be some chapters that I don't have to change. History. History doesn't really change over, right? Yeah. But you know what? I think most
[1:21:20] of the history of essential oils is so European Western focused. Yes. And so when I started to look more deeply in the WI History, I just started to realize that there was so much more influence. Yeah, from India,
[1:21:40] from China, and from the Middle East. So I, if you're anything like me as well, as soon as you finish writing it, somebody tells you somebody something else and you go, wish I put that in. Of course. And
[1:22:00] that's why, of course, I've started my own website after all these years. And so I keep, as I get new, get excited about something that it will get published as a blog on my website, which is simply salvato
[1:22:20] de alia.com au. Now, going back to this book, so your question is that information about the Happiness Report, chakras and so on is going to appear in. Volume two. This is volume one. Now volume two is probably going
[1:22:40] to take me another 12 months to finish. We'll give you, we'll give you 11. Get on with it, Sal, we wanna read it about that. No pressure. No pressure. Oh no, no pressure. Yeah, so I, I think that'll
[1:23:00] be so exciting. Yeah, but look, it's something like, for example, I visit Japan quite a lot and there was just this beautiful term yoku, which simply yes. Tell us about that Japanese term, which simply means like bathing, taking
[1:23:20] a bath in the forest. Now how do you take a bath? You don't literally take a bathtub into the forest, but it's. The term bath really means to immerse yourself. It's immerse yourself into the energy of the forest.
[1:23:40] Feel the forest, feel how nature makes you feel. And that is engage all your senses, not the smell, the sights, the feeling of the sunshine on the skin. So even tasting things. So you engage all your senses to
[1:24:00] experience the forest. So most people want to do an activity. They wanna climb up the mountain, they wanna jump through the forest park, build a hut. My son always wants to build a hut. It's all, but it's just
[1:24:20] about being, still being quiet and listening to nature, being part of nature. And this is what this term means. And then it made me realize, hey, there is a, I think somebody's come up with a term, called biophilia
[1:24:40] and it's about this deep connection we've always had with nature and all these studies. And I realized, hey, there are all these studies showing that being, spending time in nature has all these positive health outcomes. Which are related
[1:25:00] to lifestyle diseases. It makes us feel happier. It makes us, it increases our serotonin levels and dopamine levels, and so it reduces the risk of inflammatory diseases and heart disease and cardiovascular diseases. It's it's incredible the research that
[1:25:20] is going on relating to biophilia and now essentials. One of the key researchers in this area talks about, sometimes we can't get into nature, and his final paragraph, final chapter in this wonderful book that he's put together is.
[1:25:40] You can take, bring essential oils into your home. They're not gonna replace hin it in your poop, but they'll play a very important role in reconnecting you with nature. A bridge that's beautiful. A bridge. And that's a beautiful
[1:26:00] place to end up on talking about essential oils because they do whatever your favorite oil is. It's going, it's reconnecting you with your favorite part of nature. And do you know one of my very favorite things to do
[1:26:20] is to go and hang out in skincare shops? So I think you need to tell us about a very exciting new one that has opened the woods as I, I did allude to in the beginning. I do own
[1:26:40] a business called Perfect Potion, and it's, we're pretty much only in Australia and Japan at the moment. We do have some distributors that distribute our products. I don't know. I've just liked the idea of being more of a
[1:27:00] grassroots, homegrown business. I like to, think locally, we've try to source things locally, but of course with essential oils, that is not possible because essential oils, and that's why I think essential oils are a great connection with humanity
[1:27:20] because you have to discover new countries to find new essential oils. But we make a range of beautiful products here in Brisbane, Australia. We have our own manufacturing facility. Basically. I started making products from my mom and dad's
[1:27:40] kitchen back in the early eighties, and this was before we introduced the need for good manufacturing practice, GMP or quality assurance standards. But I was the quality assurer. I did everything myself. Yeah. But nowadays, so yeah we're opening
[1:28:00] up shops organically. Ah, can I just quickly tell you a story about this chap that I met in Japan who does this gas discharge visualization using curling photography equipment? Yes, please do. Yeah. You got your slide? Yeah. I
[1:28:20] can't, I'll explain it. Just go for it. Yeah. I'll go I'll explain it. But he did one particular he does it with the chakra energy centers and so on, and that was quite amazing, some of the images and
[1:28:40] maybe I can, maybe we can send them out somehow. I'm happy to share those images. That would be nice with everybody. Yeah. Yeah. To show the, in effect that the essential oils can have. But one thing, pardon the
[1:29:00] pun is I use the word we're growing the business organically. We source organic essential oils, so certified organic essential oils. Very important. He did this without me knowing. He actually grabbed a sample of our certified organic lavender oil
[1:29:20] and he grabbed a commercial grade lavender oil and he did the GDV analysis to measure the energy intensity and energy bandwidth of the oil. And what he found with the organic oil, it had a much broader bandwidth. Am
[1:29:40] I thinking about the right things? They look like they, they're a picture that looks like the aura. Yeah. No, this was just, oh no. This was just like a graph and it had these, all these lines. Oh, I
[1:30:00] see. Yeah. And, but the non-organic oil was fairly low and had a very small bandwidth, whereas the organic oil had a much higher bandwidth for the essential oil. How interesting. Which is very interesting. It was often when we
[1:30:20] talk about using essential oils at a more subtle level, energetic level, less is better, but also making sure that it is pure and organic is even more important. I would be interested to see what it came out with
[1:30:40] wild harvested to see how that compares as well. No human intervention. This is another topic. This is another topic for discussion because don't get me distracted. I'm getting hungry now. I'm getting late now. But but as there are
[1:31:00] several essential oils that it is becoming more and more difficult to collect from the wild. Correct. As a result, we've actually made some essential aromatic plants. We've put them on the endangered species list. Yep. Sandalwood is one of
[1:31:20] them. Correct. Now Australia, I like to Skype that apart from. I actually don't follow cricket or anything like that, but I dunno how our cricket team scandalous behavior compares to English cricket team or New Zealand cricket team. But
[1:31:40] I do want to mention, I think we're a pretty clever bunch out here in Australia, and one of the things that we had is happening for the first time in humankind's history is Sandalwood Sandal album is being produced
[1:32:00] from Cultivated Trees. Yes. Now, I don't think this has ever happened before in the history of humankind. We've all, in Australia, we have met, we haven't done that good a job, but we have been good systems in place
[1:32:20] to ensure that our Australia, our indigenous sandalwood, trees Al Atu are preserved. But they're still not being. Cultivated, but up in the or river region, northern regions of Western Australia, there are tens of thousands of hectares of sandalwood
[1:32:40] trees under cultivation and the essential oil they're producing is quite interesting now, which brings you, brings me back to your question. Yeah. Traditionally, sandalwood would have been harvested from a tree that was growing in the wild. Now that
[1:33:00] tree is probably a lot older as well, so I am sure that the age of the tree will affect the essential oil. Now we've proven, they've proven that the chemistry of the oil is fairly similar. Now they're producing
[1:33:20] good quality sandalwood oil from trees that are only 15 years old. Now we know and they know these farmers know, and they're keeping. Batch, the, everything is marked. This is from 2000 year, this is from 2001. And you
[1:33:40] can see, oh, this was a much better season when we planted. The trees have grown yet taken off much more quickly. But I am sure that the energetic qualities of the sand wood may be different. Correct. I'm sure
[1:34:00] that's true. Yeah. Whether they're inferior is a different kettle fish altogether, but they, the aroma is incredible. The aroma is incredible. I have smelt Australian sandalwood. It is beautiful. Which is from plantation trees. Yeah. Yeah. And look, and
[1:34:20] they've had to, what I like is I've been up there and they've created a little forest because I don't know if you are aware, but sandalwood. I don't know what the technical term is, but it's like a little
[1:34:40] vampire tree. It's a parasitic tree. Oh. It's a parasitic, it's light. It relies on host trees. And the way that they have cultivated it is quite clever. It actually relies on three different host trees, and this is allowed
[1:35:00] for the sandalwood tree itself to grow more quickly. So Is it parasitic in the way that missile toe is parasitic that the, actually the roots from another tree or just, oh, it's from the roots feed off the trees
[1:35:20] only feeding off the roots and it will eventually kill the host trees. It actually almost sucks. Everything's like sycamore s is that another tree that relies on another tree? Yeah. Oh, the invasive species here. Okay. Now it's interesting
[1:35:40] that we have dec here in Australia, they've decided they were very cautious not to introduce the traditional host trees. That will be found in Indonesia or in India and they've used some Australian native species as the host trees.
[1:36:00] So even that is that going to, once again, it doesn't affect the chemistry because we're producing this beautiful sandal, wood rich in the alpha and beta sandol. But energetically, what is that doing when we change? See, so once
[1:36:20] again, your comment was, how have the essential oils changed? Now my concern as they go from and look, the future of essential oils, I think sadly cannot continue to be wild harvested. I don't know how we, with the
[1:36:40] popularity in essential oils, it's go, we are going to decimate more native species if we continue to wild harvested take, without putting back it's interesting an oil that's now become vogue around the world. Oregano oil. I'm reading that
[1:37:00] 50 years ago, most orano oil was wild harvested. But now I think you would find it very difficult to get a wild harvested oregano oil. La It's hard to believe that once upon a time that lavender was wild
[1:37:20] harvested. But nowadays it's mostly plantation. Rowan, lavender. Yes. Got to re got to respond to demand, haven't you? Exactly. I've said this, I can't remember whose lecture I've said it in, so I'm repeating myself. But it's interesting to
[1:37:40] think of. So when when I first did my diploma back when dinosaurs wrote the earth we had to, I, I cannot believe that we had to do this vibrational experiment with lavender oils. So we were given a high
[1:38:00] alpine lavender and a Croatian lavender. And at that point, it was right in the middle of the Civil War, Yugoslavia was breaking down, Croatia, Serbia all disappearing. And honestly, you almost didn't wanna touch the Croatian oil. It was
[1:38:20] just, it felt venomous and fierce. You could feel the toxicity in the oil that was sitting in front of you. Now, I will be clear now that if you pick up a Croatian lavender, now that's not how it
[1:38:40] feels. It feels, sure I'm tranquil, so please, people know that. But yeah, just you could and it was maybe, there was chemicals in the ground perhaps from the war, but you could feel the troubles in comparison, the be
[1:39:00] tranquility of the high alpine loving. Yeah. Interesting. Because anything with so much energy also absorbs energy. Correct? Yeah. So it becomes like this. Yeah. So it retains It's like a sponge. Yeah. It's like a sponge that it, yeah.
[1:39:20] Retains the energy from the environment. So it takes on the qualities of the environment. Most definitely. Yeah. Yeah. And again, probably you wouldn't see that in the chemistry. It's been entirely, yes. Yeah. Yeah. Sal, I have loved this
[1:39:40] today. Thank you. It's been great. Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts. I've really enjoyed, thank you everybody for listening, and I hope you've really enjoyed what I've had to say. There is so much more. And I'm
[1:40:00] sorry that I haven't provided you with any. Recipe. That's very naughty behavior. Say now I'm only being kind to you. Now that you that I know you're in the mafia, so say goodbye. Before we, sorry. Don't take Elizabeth
[1:40:20] seriously on that one. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks, byebye.
