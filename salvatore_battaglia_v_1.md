**Interviewer:** Elizabeth Ashley (The Secret Healer)  
**Curator:** Gergely Hollódi  
**Publisher:** Elizabeth Ashley  
**Event:** 2018 Aromatherapy Summit  
**Title:** *Beyond the Essential Oil Recipe: Vibrational Olfaction, Subtle Energy & the Science of Scent*

---

**Transcript Summary:**
Salvatore Battaglia joins Elizabeth Ashley to explore the deep science and subtle energy implications of aromatherapy, moving well beyond recipes into the realms of vibrational olfaction, energetic healing, and aromatherapy’s future within neuroscience. The conversation includes a detailed breakdown of olfactory theory (vibration vs. shape), discussion of essential oils’ energetic signatures, chakras, endocannabinoid parallels, and the cultural/philosophical frameworks that shape our therapeutic understanding.

Key themes:
- Luca Turin’s vibrational theory of olfaction
- G-protein receptors and olfactory mapping
- Endocannabinoid system parallels
- Chakras, nerve plexuses, and neurotransmission
- GDV/Kirlian photography and subtle energy
- Historical perspectives on scent (Ayurveda, TCM, Western lineage)
- Ethical harvesting, sustainability, and vibrational purity of oils
- Essential oils and consciousness, referencing Dr. Bach and David Kennedy

**Notable Quotes:**
- "As long as our souls and personalities are in harmony, all is joy and peace... This conflict is the root cause of disease." —Dr. Edward Bach, quoted by Battaglia
- "Understanding smell is the final frontier of science."
- "Scent is the one constant across all spiritual traditions."
- "Essential oils burst out of the bottle—they want to be smelled."
- "When the body is cancering, olfactory neurons appear in the tissue."
