### Interview Transcription
**Elizabeth Ashley:** Hello and welcome to the Beyond the Essential Oil Recipe Summit.  
I'm Elizabeth Ashley, The Secret Healer, and today I am very excited to be joined by my very dear friend, Madeleine Kerkhof. The Queen, I have to say, of CO₂ medicine, but also the most wonderful speaker on palliative care, and I'm so honored to have you here. Madeline, thank you for taking the time.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Hello everybody. Great to be here.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Now I'm sure that most people listening will know who you are and know about your background, but if there isn't anybody, tell us a little bit about where you come from and what your background in aromatherapy is.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Okay, so I'm Madeleine, and I used to be a nurse. In my training and beyond, I got really frustrated that people only talked about the diagnosis on the staff and not about the patient with the diagnosis. I got so frustrated that I ended up quitting my job. I looked beyond nursing and beyond medicine, looking into more natural ways and holistic care—where we could pay attention to the patient with the disease rather than just the diagnosis. For me, that was a life-changing experience to widen my horizon, in the Netherlands and abroad, to offer patients more care than just for their physical wellbeing.

So I looked in spas, hospitals for natural care, and studied with many people—more on the job and in practice than in school. I really got into aromatherapy from about 1991, and that did it for me. I'm also an herbalist.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** A brave and noble leap of faith—that must have been terrifying to make that change.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** It was, but it also turned out really well. Now, I’m also an herbalist and a nutritionist, though I don’t work with herbs and nutrition much anymore. My focus now is mainly aromatherapy.

That gave me a good backbone for treating patients in my own practice. Now, I don't treat patients anymore—I only educate around the world, mostly on palliative care.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** And so what kind of nurse were you before? What sort of people did you treat? Were they cancer patients or more general nursing?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** I started out in gynecology. By coincidence, of course, many patients had cancer. The doctors would say, "I’m gonna help you; you’re gonna help me treat this patient with a uterus extirpation."

But I wanted to take care of that woman who was only 30 years old, who would lose her uterus because of cancer. I never knew if she would survive. This was 1980. Also, she was in crisis because she never could have children, which she always wanted.

That was a major reason why I had to look elsewhere—I couldn’t do much for her. I was only 18 or 19 years old. I was very young. She died not too long after, and there were quite a few other young cancer patients on my ward.

That taught me that this way of practicing medicine was maybe good for physical things—surgery, chemotherapy—but there was no psychosocial aid. We didn’t even know the word palliative care then.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yeah.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** So I knew that wasn’t the way. I’m very empathic; I want to be a holistic nurse and look at the whole picture, not just the physical.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** There’s been much change in the last 30, 40 years.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Yeah, exactly.
**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Much has changed. Even now in hospitals, there is much more attention to whole wellbeing, not just physical health.

But I think that, certainly in the UK, nurses are so pressed for time.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Oh, yeah.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** They don’t have enough time to spend with patients properly and to give them the support they need.

While you are saying that, I have become very skilled at offering nurses ways to work with patients.

Yesterday I was in a hospice, and we did an abdominal wash for constipation. You might think that takes at least 20 minutes—abdominal massage and all that—but it only takes two minutes. It’s a very technical nurse’s intervention. It’s not so holistic because it’s technical, but on the other hand, it offers enormous wellbeing. If you can go to the loo for the first time in days because someone did a two-minute intervention with just a washcloth and fresh water—that makes a huge difference.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Oh yeah, that makes a hell of a difference.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** So yes, it helps people have a bowel movement or urinate.

I’m not going into it too much because this is about aromatherapy, but diffusing essential oils takes as much time as opening a window.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Exactly right.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** So it can be short and sweet. You can take the nurse out of the hospital, but you can never take the nurse out of the nurse. I’ve learned to work with nurses by offering them interventions that don’t take much time but provide great wellbeing.

Sometimes therapists frown upon me because they have time.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** How rude of them! If any of you are frowning, be mad at them because they have time—consider yourself slapped by me.

I had to learn to teach therapists because they have much more time and possibilities than hospice nurses.

Sometimes I broaden my horizon to tune into therapists because they have possibilities nurses don’t.

But I’m an expert in nursing. In fairness, I’ve achieved much in the Dutch nursing field worldwide.

Many hospices, nursing homes, and home care settings now use what I teach, partly because I don’t teach an hour-long massage—the nurses don’t have time for that.

But they can do so many other things with scent, wound gels, or inhalers for nausea that we make.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Before we explore those areas, I’m interested—why did aromatherapy become your focus over nutrition and herbalism? What was it about aromatherapy that spoke to you?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Do you want the honest answer or the diplomatic one?

**Elizabeth Ashley:** The honest one. You know me.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** The diplomatic answer is that I love it and don’t want to work much with herbs.

But the real answer is that working with herbs in hospitals or professional healthcare is a nightmare.

Patients are on medication, and nurses need to be trained as herbalists to understand indications, contraindications, possible interactions, and the short hospital stays.

It’s different in nursing homes or home care, but the time is limited.

Herbalists have a better role in private or doctor’s practices where they can take time to evaluate herbs and nutrition.

For a nurse, that’s hard.

Learning aromatherapy isn’t easy either. There are contraindications, indications, and possible interactions, but many safe ways to use oils don’t require much worry.

You get to recognize patterns of problems.

But scent does so much for you.

You don’t have to do a full treatment to offer wellbeing.

If you diffuse an essential oil that provokes lovely memories for an elderly person in a nursing home, you don’t even have to do more.

You can achieve much wellbeing by just diffusing an oil or using an aroma patch for sleep.

It’s much easier than giving valerian tea at night.

Aromatherapy is versatile, and from that point of view, it can be passive.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** It’s passive as well, isn’t it? From that point of view, I hadn’t really thought of that before. When treating patients and training these wonderful nurses who go out to do the work—that is my main occupation: training nurses.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** How do you go about assessing what the primary needs are? Do you look at the physical body first, or do you address it from an emotional aspect? Tell me about that. How do you decide?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** When I’m called to a patient myself, I look in a very clinical way, so I do an assessment. What is the main problem? Usually, palliative care patients have more than one problem, but if it’s nausea, for example, I see if they are nauseous despite their medication. Then I focus first on that issue: Why is the nausea there? What can I expect from treatment?

If the nausea is due to squash stomach syndrome because they have a bowel tumor, the diaphragm will be stimulated all the time, causing continuous nausea and vomiting. But if nausea is from chemotherapy, it’s a different cause. You may not be able to address the cause directly, but you can achieve more relief for chemotherapy-induced nausea than nausea originating deep in the abdomen.

Then I look at which essential oils I could use. Normally, I choose about four or five. I ask patients what they like or dislike in fragrances. I check their medical file for contraindications.

Then I make a blend and have them sniff it. Of course, if you’re nauseous, you don’t want to smell anything that makes it worse. The worst nausea I ever had was when I was pregnant—I couldn’t be near any smell.

All of that is part of my assessment before blending. I consider the severity of nausea and which essential oils have the most evidence and experience for treating it. I also consider the emotional side.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Lavender on my deathbed. I swear I’ll come back.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** My goodness.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Sorry, I like lavender fields in Provence, but I wanted to finish my story here—if I were the patient, I wouldn’t necessarily want lavender in the blend.

Lavender is very calming. So if you have a stressed patient who keeps vomiting, you may want to add lavender.

That is how I address the picture—even when treating a physical symptom, I approach it clinically.

You wrote to me in your email asking if I go by top notes, middle notes, and base notes.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Usually I don’t. I go by clinical assessment and clinical aromatherapy. I follow the steps a nurse uses to decide the intervention—whether natural or conventional—which helps structure treatment.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I agree. When I write recipes, I tend to go middle, top, middle base—but that’s a lie. When I do it myself, I just pick oils. For nausea, peppermint, spearmint, mandarin, chamomile, or ginger?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Ginger CO₂ total extract is my one oil for any type of nausea. That would be my main oil. Then I work with peppermint, spearmint, and lemon.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Peppermint and lemon have research too.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Also lavender, and if it’s really bad, I add spikenard.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I was going to say spikenard goes in every blend for me.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** So maybe four oils, something like that.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** What are the main applications you use the oils for?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Diffusion to clean a room—either of germs or negative atmosphere or tension—and to make a nice ambience. I do inhalation for nausea, respiratory tract issues, sleep, and emotional support. I use inhalers all the time.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Are we talking about those little sniffy sticks?
**Elizabeth Ashley:** That’s what you’re calling an inhaler. I love them. I simply love them because they give self-reliance back to patients. They can control their own symptoms, especially nausea, dyspnea, and anxiety. I have them on planes all the time. When I go over in October, I’ll keep sniffing my inhaler.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Flying isn’t my thing.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** But you’re having me on—considering how much you’ve traveled this year, you must not hate it as much as I do.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Actually, I do. But I love being there and spreading these messages, especially for oncology and palliative care.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** And then you also use aroma patches a lot.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Yes.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I’ve never used an aroma patch. Tell me how they work. Is it like a sticker you put oils on and then stick on the skin?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** No. It’s a little plaster—an innovation from America. I got it from Botanica 2016. I met a gentleman there, and I send my blends to the US; they come back in little pouches. It’s a little plaster with a felt circle that absorbs the oil. You can add up to five oils.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Then you stick it on the chest of the patient?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Yes, or next to their chest—on their PJs or pillows. Through the skin’s warmth, the fragrance develops a bit more. Through inhalation only, it gets into the nose and works its magic.

It doesn’t get absorbed by the skin—I don’t want to put pure oil on the skin unless necessary. It’s only scent.

I use it a lot for patients who can’t use an inhaler—maybe paralyzed on one side and can’t open the inhaler, or for people with mental disabilities who don’t understand inhalers.

I’ve also been honored to guide patients at the last threshold with a patch on their chest. It’s profound—a wonderful thing at the last stage.

You have to do it right—you can’t do it again. You need your assessment right and suitable, safe oils. Be careful, especially in the last hours, about fragrance type and intensity.

But if you do it right, you can make the difference between a restless deathbed and a quiet, peaceful one.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** How do you choose the oils? Are you looking at how scared they are or what symptoms to address?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** You look at symptoms that could disturb the deathbed—nausea, dyspnea. Usually, anxiety and restlessness are the main concerns, and aromatherapy can be very helpful.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** What sort of oils do you choose in that situation?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** It depends on the patient. I love mandarin, bergamot, and high-altitude lavender—not necessarily normal lavender, but a high-altitude one.

They’re pure, ethereal, very light—almost like angelic notes around the aura.

I need reliable information from family or close friends if the patient is unconscious, so I’m hesitant without that.

If the patient has received complementary therapies during their illness, you usually know what they like, and you can help them along with fragrance choices.

It can be anything.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** It’s interesting—some patients in coma still respond to scent. Some say it’s placebo, but it’s not really a placebo.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** There’s enough research to say we don’t do research on dying patients—it’s not ethical—but many fragrances have calming effects.

Addressing pain early helps people be more serene, reducing anxiety and changing pain perception.

They might feel less pain—not because pain is gone, but perception changes.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Is that placebo?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Maybe.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Maybe, but who cares? Placebo is real.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Exactly. Placebo isn’t bad; it makes a difference.

It’s definite thinking—self-belief.

It also helps family members see their loved one pass in peace.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Can you share a story?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Yes, a few years ago in the largest hospice in the Netherlands, an elderly woman with bowel cancer and mild dementia was restless and yelling at night, plucking blankets.

Her husband was afraid to leave her alone, worried she’d pass or get more restless without him.

We used one drop each of high-altitude lavender from Haute Provence, mandarin, and frankincense CO₂ extract on a small diffuser each night.

In the last four nights, she was more peaceful.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Therapy for both of them, isn’t it?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Yes. Lavender is relaxing, mandarin is highly relaxing and sleep-promoting, and frankincense helps connect spiritually.

She loved lavender from holidays in Provence, mandarin appealed to the child in her, and frankincense was associated with church rituals.

A holistic approach to her last days.

What touches me is that her husband also found peace—he didn’t have to sedate her, so his memory of her passing is more peaceful.

This story is in my book on palliative care.

Three simple oils made a difference.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Tremendous kindness.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** It’s not just for end of life; aromatherapy helps earlier stages and oncology symptoms.

I’m teaching a pain class in Atlanta in November, not just for palliative care but also broader.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Beautiful.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** I wanted to go back to something you said about cleaning the environment—the atmosphere of a room.

When you do that, do you use one blend or several?

**Elizabeth Ashley:** It depends on the room and if people need to be there.

I’d be cautious diffusing oils in living rooms, schools, or nurseries because of allergies.

I’d wait until a room is empty or diffuse overnight.

In hospital hallways or kitchens without people, it’s fine.

I tend to use simple oils.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Yes.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** When you think about helping someone in their last hours, you’d expect base notes or sedatives, but you pick uplifting, happy, gentle oils.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Yes, bringing light and sunshine.

I use mandarin and bergamot a lot. There’s minor research on their anxiety-relieving effects.

I also use spikenard but avoid it with haloperidol, an antipsychotic used in elderly care, due to possible interactions.

I’m cautious about interactions; it’s my integrity as a nurse and therapist.
**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yeah, I agree. In an acute situation, I was once asked to help someone write a book about essential oils for kidney patients. They were interested in how we could help with aspects of dialysis and related issues. Do you get involved with problems like sores where tubes have gone in, or is your work more on the emotional side?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Actually, I’m more involved in wound care. It’s tricky because nurses and doctors often call me about wounds that can’t be healed by other means—when people have their backs against the wall, I get called in.

That should be done earlier, but I understand when wounds are very bad and other treatments fail.

I had a patient with severe diabetes—not my patient, but living far away. His granddaughter contacted me because she heard about my success with wound healing.

We started with carbonated baths, a way to improve oxygenation.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** What’s a carbonated bath?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** It’s like CO₂ but used in water for foot baths, not for plant extraction. CO₂ develops in water creating little bubbles that attach to the skin like a bubble bath, helping veins to widen in the periphery and draw oxygen-rich blood to the skin. This aids wound healing.

We did this, dried his foot well because moist feet are bad for diabetes, and applied a wound gel multiple times daily. The granddaughter did this independently, alongside the carbonated baths.

The wound healed in about three or four months. It took time because the patient had spiky blood sugar levels, which complicate healing.

We prevented a planned amputation approved by the vascular surgeon.

He later died of pneumonia in his eighties but avoided amputation, allowing him to live at home with care from a nurse and granddaughter, avoiding nursing home admission and surgery complications.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Amazing.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Carbonated baths can be done by anyone; no hospital equipment needed. You just need a foot soak bath and two powder components to add to warm water. The CO₂ bubbles form in the bath.

I’m all about simplicity—that’s my middle name. Actually, I have three middle names: safety, palliative care, and simplicity.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Nothing simple about you!

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Fair enough.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I’m fascinated. You can’t avoid telling me what oils you used. My guess is myrrh and helichrysum?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** I use myrrh, helichrysum, a base of food-grade gel (freshest), sea buckthorn CO₂ total seed extract, tamanu, lavender oil, and a bit of blue chamomile.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Amazing. It’s fascinating how we approach things differently—chemistry, etheric—but come up with similar oils.

I’d never have thought of sea buckthorn CO₂ extract, but otherwise our choices are alike. How is using CO₂ extracts different from essential oils in practice?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Distilled oils require hot steam and relatively low pressure. CO₂ extraction uses relatively low temperatures but massive pressure, capturing more molecules that don’t travel with steam.

For example, ginger CO₂ total extract contains gingerol and shogaol, not found in distilled oil, and these have researched positive effects on nausea.

I prefer oils with scientific backing. For wound care, CO₂ extracts promote healing and peripheral circulation in diabetic patients.

Caraway CO₂ extract has similar carvacrol content to essential oil; clinically, it doesn’t matter which you use.

Fragrances in CO₂ extracts are often richer, assembling the plant’s components better than essential oils.

For example, sage CO₂ extract is far more aromatic than distilled sage oil—like rubbing the plant in your hand.

I’ve been specializing in CO₂ extracts for about 10 years and wrote a clinical book about them.

In my descriptions, I include emotional uses too, especially for elderly and dementia patients—the fragrances evoke better memories.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** That can be positive or negative.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Exactly.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Is there ever a case where you’d prefer distilled essential oil over CO₂?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Not black and white, but with chamomile, it’s interesting.

CO₂ extraction doesn’t produce chamazulene (needs heat, water, oxygen), but distilled chamomile does.

We were puzzled by analyses showing chamazulene in CO₂ extracts, but it turned out they analyzed steam-distilled samples.

I use distilled chamomile oil for wound care, too.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** What color is the CO₂ extract?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Slurry green.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** How rude! It’s been robbed!

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** The fragrance is minimal compared to the full blue chamomile field smell of distilled oil.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Not a nice scent.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** But it has healing properties. Matricin (in CO₂ extract) may have higher anti-inflammatory effects than chamazulene, but research isn’t conclusive yet.

I use both to benefit from each molecule.

It’s also recommended for allergic skin reactions like eczema—great antihistamine.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I love chamomile more than lavender.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** I like most oils except lavender, peppermint, rosemary.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I hate peppermint and rosemary.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** I love them.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Funny, isn’t it?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Personality thing.

Before we move on, anything else you want to share about using aromatherapy in palliative care that people would find useful?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** I’m not sure.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Everyone I know wants to know more.

Tell us about your books.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** My book was published in 2015.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Is it mainly aimed at nurses?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Not at all. Originally written in Dutch, it matches Dutch palliative care guidelines.

Dutch nurses reading about anxiety find options and fragrances suggested.

For UK, US, and other countries, the layout may be confusing, but it’s a very clinical book.

It also addresses emotional wellbeing and spiritual care.

Though called complementary nursing, it’s useful for therapists too.

There are many blends and suggestions for non-palliative care patients too, like those in oncology who are still curative.

But it mainly targets end-of-life care.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Okay.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** The book centers around 10 essential oils as a red thread.

I want these oils to be well-founded, manageable, safe, obtainable, affordable—depending on country.

These 10 oils form the base for many blends.

Extra special oils include some CO₂ extracts, chamomile, and rose oil—not typically in basic kits.

This keeps it affordable.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** So with these 10 oils you can do so much?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Yes, plus about 30 to 40 other oils and some base oils, mostly obtainable worldwide.

I’m practical and pragmatic—I don’t recommend oils that are hard to find, which only complicates things.

People dealing with stress don’t need that.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Unless you’re a therapist who already knows essential oils well.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Then the book offers a lot on general palliative care: pain origin, types of pain, how essential oils help, and options like guided imagery for pain distraction.

There’s a lot to know about palliative care, and I’ve tried to make the book a complete resource with essential oils and blends, but without too many oils.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I can’t recommend it enough.

I also can’t recommend your CO₂ book highly enough.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** I never get enough time to read it either.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I heard the section on cannabis is very good.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** A good friend wrote that piece.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Liz?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Yes.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Thank you for that.

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Thank you. I got a letter from the post office about a parcel—I thought it was a bill.

It was a lovely surprise: a free copy of the book, which I treasure.

Thank you.

I treasure your expertise because I’m an aromatherapist and herbalist, but I didn’t have enough background to speak on cannabis.

It will have its place in aromatherapy but is quite tricky.
**Madeleine Kerkhof:** Because you need to know quite a bit about it. Also, the legal status of cannabis oil and CBD oil is still complicated. I felt I needed to consult the only expert in Europe anyway.

I’m so grateful to my colleagues who contributed to my book with their stories and experiences—like Marika Fleuri from Malta, Michael Istead with his herbal drink, whom we met at Botanica in the last two editions.

Quite a few others too, including Marge Clarke, Li Wong, and Priya. Their contributions really made the book come to life.

Of course, I shared my own experiences with wound gel and berry cream that I make.

I think CO₂ extracts have a great future in aromatherapy. With this book, I hope to shed light on myths about CO₂ extracts—not always stronger, but sometimes—and explain the other molecules present besides essential oils, what they do, and what’s still unknown.

Some experts are advancing knowledge, which is great.

I appreciate how simple and accessible the book is. Sometimes CO₂ research can be overwhelming.

Manufacturers were generous in sharing their procedures, which helped me a lot.

They may have commercial interests, but genuinely wanted me to help people understand CO₂ better so it can be implemented in aromatherapy.

I see CO₂ extracts as a bridge between herbalism and aromatherapy—I started in herbalism before aromatherapy.

This book is also useful for herbalists who want to use CO₂ extracts safely with patients.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** And tell us about your courses. You’re like a rockstar—you’re on tour, aren’t you?

**Madeleine Kerkhof:** I don’t like flying at all, but I sacrifice it to be with all you guys. This year, I’m doing the USA again for a month, and then Hong Kong.

We have KIIC in Hong Kong—the Knowledge Institute for Integrative and Complementary Care—with premises there and a chief educator, Kaman Joan, who also contributed to the CO₂ book. I teach specialized CO₂ classes there annually.

I also do a three-day CO₂ extract course with Gabriel Mojay in June, in Hong Kong and the Netherlands.

If you want to visit the Netherlands, come in March for the CO₂ course. That’s when I’m in Seattle with Cynthia.

I developed Fusion Aromatherapy—an integrated approach combining essential oils and CO₂ extracts for seriously ill patients.

There’s Fusion Aromatherapy for the dying, for pain (a November class at the Hill Center), and for elderly care in Hong Kong (December).

In April, I run a nine-day palliative care program at my school in the Netherlands, covering physical, emotional, and spiritual care, hospice visits, and excursions.

The timing coincides with the tulip garden opening—beautiful springtime.

Next year, I’ll speak at Aromatica in Australia, invited by Debbie Aby. I look forward to seeing my Australian friends.

I’ll also visit Malta to see Marika, and attend the Integrative Nursing Conference in Galway, Ireland, organized by the University of Minnesota. Nurses, get ready for May 22–24! I submitted a workshop abstract and hope to be accepted.

I’m excited about Budapest next year to see you and everyone, though we might not get much time to chat before then.

Thank you—it’s humbling and an honor to be part of the aromatherapy community.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Thank you, darling. Bye bye.
