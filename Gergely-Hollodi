## üìú Full Transcript
**Elizabeth Ashley:** Hello and welcome to the Beyond the Essential Oil Recipe Summit. I'm Elizabeth Ashley, the Secret Healer, and if you're watching on Facebook Live, get ready to like and share because I have somebody rather special today. He's been hidden in the background through most of the summit, I have to say. But today I am so excited to introduce you to the co-creator of the Beyond the Essential Oil Recipe Summit. G! Hello, Gergely. How are you?

**Gergely Hollodi:** Good morning. How are you, Liz?

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I'm very well, my darling. How are you?

**Gergely Hollodi:** Great. Sunny day here again in Budapest.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Beautiful. Now, just to make you aware, Gergely, it is quite quiet, so you probably need to speak up a little bit more than that. Is that okay with you?

**Gergely Hollodi:** Sure. Fantastic. Can you hear me now?

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I can hear you now. Okay. So if there is anybody who doesn't know who you are, can you tell us a little bit about your background?

**Gergely Hollodi:** Where shall I start? How far back should I go?

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Year dot, wherever you think is relevant.

**Gergely Hollodi:** 1855. Oh, no, seriously. My background originally, after university‚ÄîI actually graduated as an English teacher, so English major, let's say. I started working for about one, one and a half years at an advertising company. So I pretty much spent 12 years in marketing. Not really marketing‚ÄîI was on the production side, and that's why I'm doing the production for this summit as well.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** That's why everything looks so beautiful, because Gergely is a little bit of a wizard with things like that.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Yeah. I'm not a designer, but I was working with printing, TV production, photographers, and stuff, which I really loved. But after spending a little over 12 years in advertising, as with many people, I guess you really start thinking about, is this really what I want to do?

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Right.

**Gergely Hollodi:** After probably a year of not knowing what to do, I started thinking more seriously, and with the support of my ex-wife, I quit and started going into something different. A friend of mine, a coach, worked with me on discovering what I wanted to do. Through all the tests and sessions, it turned out that I had always been very close to colors, spicy cooking, aromas, and the like.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I love that!

**Gergely Hollodi:** A little after that, I went to Seattle, where my ex-wife is from. I started working, funny enough, for a direct marketing company, which I couldn't do for very long‚Äîabout three or four months.

By the time I got to Seattle, I immediately started looking for essential oils and for schools in the US. That's how I actually signed up shortly after arriving in Seattle for Jade Shutes' school, which was then called the East West School for Herbal and Aromatic Studies. Then it changed names to the School for Aromatic Studies, and now it‚Äôs called the New York Institute of Aromatherapy.

Then I came back to Hungary that summer, the first summer after three months for a visit, and by the time I got back to the US, I had already signed up for what I think is one of the best schools in the US‚Äîmassage school‚Äîwhich was then called the Brenneke School of Massage.

I graduated from Jade's school and from massage therapy school, started working in the US, and then returned to Hungary in 2009. That‚Äôs when I really started my venture into aromatherapy and began teaching for Jade‚Äôs school in Hungary. So now I am an instructor of the New York Institute of Aromatherapy in Hungary.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Wonderful.

**Gergely Hollodi:** And of course, I completed my phytotherapy studies here in Hungary because I think it‚Äôs important for an aromatherapist to know more about the plants, not just about the oils. It‚Äôs herbal studies, pretty much.

To keep it short, that‚Äôs my background in aromatherapy.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** But how we met was through your work on the magazine, on Aromatica, wasn‚Äôt it?


**Gergely Hollodi:** Yeah. So in 2014, I was thinking about there's a gap for literature in Hungarian about aromatherapy essential oils. So with one of my former students, we decided to start this magazine, which is called Aromatica. And then gladly enough, I had quite many friends from around the world in the aromatherapy field, and they helped me with articles that we could translate and then started gathering.

Some people from Hungary were specializing in essential oils or herbs or dietary and so on and so forth. So we get many articles and we use people's articles from around the world who deal with essential oils. And this is how we met, because yes, remember how it worked out, but someone, I think it was Gabriel Mojay who suggested that there's this lady who writes very eloquently and creatively, and that's how I found you.

And I asked, "Hey, listen, write articles for our magazine."

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yeah.

**Gergely Hollodi:** The rest is‚Äî

**Elizabeth Ashley:** History. A great friendship ever since, because I have to say whatever I write looks far more beautiful when Gergely had his hands on it. And you'll see that when you see his presentation because he has quite the gift.

So now I want to let you in on a secret. Everybody, every time we've spoken about this, he's gone. Let me tell you about your presentation. I've been going, no, I don't wanna hear your presentation until I hear your presentation. So this is gonna be a surprise to me. So tell us a little bit about what you're gonna talk about today, Gergely.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Okay, so first of all, I don't know if I should call it a presentation or maybe just a thought-provoking talk with Elizabeth Ashley about this.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yeah.

**Gergely Hollodi:** When we started the whole summit, we said we have to have our presentation.

I was going through all those wonderful people from around the world and then looking at their topics and their lectures, wondering what shall I talk about? What shall I‚ÄîI‚Äôm not really very much a scientific guy as this, but I consider myself more on the creative side. And I was thinking, what shall I talk about?

What shall I talk about? And then I came up with this idea, which is I think the presentation title is ‚ÄúThe Human Archetypes of Essential Oils through the Chemistry Lab,‚Äù I think.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Credits.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Yeah, I'm correct about myself.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** And then it sounds‚Äî

**Gergely Hollodi:** Very interesting. And then what the presentation is about, or this podcast is about, is pretty much my findings over the years of teaching about chemistry.

So it's not like something very explicit or scientific. I think it's rather more like an interesting topic that we can talk about.

And then what makes people think from a different angle, looking at chemistry.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Do you want to share your screen?

**Gergely Hollodi:** I sure want to share my screen.

Here it is. Can you see? Look.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** At that already. How beautiful is that? Tell us what I'm seeing.

**Gergely Hollodi:** You see a picture from a free image website.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Cheat.

**Gergely Hollodi:** But I chose this picture because I thought it represents nature, trees, and plants, and then we have these dummy faces, which could be anybody. Certainly like humans or persons, but we don't have, behind their faces‚Äî

**Elizabeth Ashley:** They look like Egyptian city. They have face‚Äî

**Gergely Hollodi:** But they don't have the necessary features like the color of an eye or hair, the garment, or red. Nothing. They are dummies. So this is pretty much like a white paper to fill out, isn't it?

Okay. So here is the title of the presentation. And‚Äî

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yeah, that is exactly my face. It's chemistry.

**Gergely Hollodi:** And I know that a lot of people, including some of the speakers in this summit, when they talk about chemistry, it could be a clich√© what I'm using now, but this is really true.

When you look at chemistry‚Äîand this is based on me teaching here in Hungary for about 10 years now‚Äîwhen we get to a point in a course when we cover chemistry, a lot of people have faces like this guy‚Äôs face. It was like, I don‚Äôt want to talk about it. Obviously, many people‚Äînot many people, but I would say at least 10% of the students I was teaching had an affinity to chemistry. They loved chemistry. And myself, when I was at secondary school, I loved chemistry.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Oh, did you?

**Gergely Hollodi:** Oh, I did love chemistry, but unfortunately‚Äîand this is something that probably many people would agree with‚Äîmy teacher wasn't the best to motivate me. So I got a little bit demotivated. So I dropped chemistry. I went into English. But the majority of the people who join me in these courses, when we get to the point of chemistry, beforehand they say, "Oh, I can't, I just can't do chemistry. It‚Äôs frightening."

I‚Äôm not just‚Äî

**Elizabeth Ashley:** They dread it coming, don‚Äôt they? The chemistry lesson.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Not just that. I have to memorize Latin names. "Oh, Latin names! What do I do with Latin names?" I have to memorize each component‚Äôs name. Then you have these strange names for the chemical groups.

So people get old and say, "Oh my God, I really want to miss this class." And it is true, especially if you don't come from a background where scientific language is used, you are not happy with it. Pretty much, I want to use the oils. I‚Äôm not interested in the names. I‚Äôm not interested in the theory. But you come, and you are here in this course, and part of your education is chemistry

**Elizabeth Ashley:** It definitely adds a deeper understanding of the safety, if nothing else, but also which organs it will help as well, doesn't it?

**Gergely Hollodi:** Exactly. So there are several reasons to know your chemistry better rather than not. This is usually the reaction I get from many people.

And I pull up the next slide. How I came up with this idea for this presentation is pretty much that I was looking for some kind of a tool that could make people become friendlier‚Äîor like friends, maybe not friends, but just familiar‚Äîwith chemistry.

And then what shall I do? Obviously, if you see this slide, there‚Äôs a grid with many colors. I‚Äôm pretty sure a lot of people who teach aromatherapy try to use all sorts of tools so that people can memorize and become more familiar, feel more comfortable studying. One of those tools is colors. But the problem is not everyone is visual.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I‚Äôm not.

**Gergely Hollodi:** As we know. What do you like to do? What do you think your strength is?

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Oh, I‚Äôm an auditory learner. Okay. I have to listen to things.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Very good. So some people are visual. Even when we talk with each other, in language‚Äîit‚Äôs absolutely true that when you talk, how many times have you heard someone say, ‚ÄúI see what you mean‚Äù? The more they use those phrases, the more you can be sure they‚Äôre primarily visual.

So colors could work for visual people. They can have anchors for what they want to memorize or take away. But not everyone is visual, as you say. Some people are auditory. And then there are people who are kinesthetic. Kinesthetic means you learn through movement.

Also, smell is a kinesthetic sense as we usually list it.

So I was thinking about the auditory learners‚Äîthey like to listen. I hear this from many teachers. This is one way, when you look at chemical groups in organic chemistry found in essential oils, like sesquiterpenes, monoterpenes, pinoles, most materials say, ‚ÄúOh yeah, it ends in ‚Äò-ol,‚Äô‚Äù which helps you recognize the group. Unfortunately, phenols also end in ‚Äò-ol,‚Äô or monoterpenes end in ‚Äò-ene.‚Äô So that‚Äôs not really a help, is it? It gives you a little handle to grab, but maybe not.

So I was thinking, how can I come up with something more playful that people can identify with?

I thought about games. As we know, even with children‚Äîyou have children, so you know many children...

**Credits:** But‚Äî

**Gergely Hollodi:** I remember that games and playing is an excellent tool for education and learning. Many people say kids learn through games and playing, including ourselves in the past.

So I was thinking, okay, what shall I do? I‚Äôve been exercising this for many years, and even now I do it. Every now and then, when I don‚Äôt have to work on the Beyond the Essential Oil Recipe Summit...

**Elizabeth Ashley:** A minute to month?

**Gergely Hollodi:** In the morning, when I wake, I usually wake up, and when I was learning oils myself, I always started the day with one bottle of essential oil.

Before I did anything, I started smelling that as soon as I woke up. This was the first impression of the day. Then this helped me absorb and understand the oils. I‚Äôd do one oil for a week. Every day you wake up and smell the same oil.

Then you start to understand the different layers, the different emotions that they bring out from me. One day I was smelling one of these bottles‚ÄîI believe it was Magnolia.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Ooh, nice. Which is a‚Äî

**Gergely Hollodi:** Fairly unusual oil. People don‚Äôt use Magnolia very much.
**Elizabeth Ashley:** My mom's very favorite oil is magnolia.

**Gergely Hollodi:** I love that oil. For me, it brings out a sensation of Aico Jam.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Oh, yes. I can see that.

**Gergely Hollodi:** You try smelling magnolia, and this is my sensation. We are all different and have our individual thoughts about an oil.

But anyways, it was magnolia, and then one day what came to my mind suddenly was a Clint painting‚ÄîClints.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Oh, how lovely. I do.

**Gergely Hollodi:** The Austrian painter with all those colors and figures. I didn‚Äôt know where it came from, but it just was like Clints. I had it in my mind.

Then I was thinking about Clint‚Äîokay, so he has these pictures, and what sort of person was Clint? I didn‚Äôt read his biography or anything, sorry if there‚Äôs one‚Äîbut I was thinking, wow, if someone paints like this, what could this person be like?

For the next course, I thought, okay, this is really thought-provoking, it‚Äôs creative stuff. So why don‚Äôt I use it in chemistry?

What happened was these people came for the next course, and usually one day is dedicated to chemistry. I started the day with chemistry and said, ‚ÄúOkay, don‚Äôt worry, because we‚Äôre going to be playful at the end of the chemistry session.‚Äù

At the end of the session, I said, ‚ÄúOkay, I made this‚ÄîI looked at, not what‚Äôs on the screen, but the structural energy system.‚Äù

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yeah.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Many people around the world who teach aromatherapy use this chart.

It was originally worked out by Frank and Panol, as you can see. I‚Äôm not talking about the system itself, but how I‚Äôm teaching based on the structure of the energy system. These are the chemical groups in organic chemistry represented in essential oils.

Some of them are structured by functional groups. I have 11 or 12 groups depending. I wrote the names on little pieces of paper, folded them up.

When I had people in class at the end of the day, I said, ‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs split into two or three groups, depending on the number of students. Let‚Äôs say minimum two students per group. Each group had to name a captain or coach.‚Äù

The coach came up and pulled from the pile one group of chemical groups.

Then they shared it with the other group, saying, ‚ÄúI pulled aldehydes.‚Äù

**Credits:** Right?

**Gergely Hollodi:** I gathered all my assortment of oils, as much as I could‚Äînot just the ones in the course book, but as many as I had because I love essential oils.

Then I gave those bottles to help the students find them. I told them the names, and they collected all the essential oils in that group. The group was chosen based on the essential oil representing a large amount of that chemical component, such as‚Äîif you‚Äôre talking about lemongrass, it has a good percentage, if not the majority, composed of aldehydes.
**Gergely Hollodi:** So then we got a group of oils for each group of students. They collected the essential oils and got smell strips.

What they had to do in the group was smell the oils‚Äîthey could use the smell strips. I asked them to actually smell all the oils together so they would have a complete impression of the group as a whole. They could, in themselves, represent a perfume sometimes.

Then I asked them to create a personality‚Äîor you could say impersonate, personalize, or whatever word we use‚Äîfor the group of essential oils, their overall sensation, their overall impression of the group.

I asked them to figure out if it was a man or a woman, what color the eyes would be, what sort of hair.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Oh, wow. That‚Äôs really detailed.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Yes. As many adjectives and thoughts as they had about those oils, as a group they had to put down and create this personality for this group of oils.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I‚Äôm excited.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Yeah. That‚Äôs a fun game because people love smelling. They love being creative, and they came up with all sorts of solutions. It was fun. I saw that people loved it, so I decided to use it for the next group as well.

I‚Äôve been using it for probably more than six years for sure.

**Credits:** Wow.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Then I just put those pieces of paper that described these personalities into a folder. I was happy; they were happy. I usually have two to three courses a year, and I started noticing that two groups later, or two courses later, there was a group that pulled ‚Äúmonoterpene pins.‚Äù

They pulled ‚Äúmonoterpene pins‚Äù again, and I saw their description. I thought, that‚Äôs very interesting‚Äîthey really came up with a very similar description.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Oh, so you‚Äôre seeing trends between the groups.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Yes. I wondered if there was a trend. I waited for another group, another course, and started collecting all these papers.

It‚Äôs very funny that people really don‚Äôt know each other‚Äîthey are different people, separated by time and space. Some people referred friends to the course, but they don‚Äôt talk about it per se.

It turned out that people have very similar descriptions of these personalities. That‚Äôs why I call it an archetype. Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt call it an archetype because these aren‚Äôt archetypes, but I had to name them somehow.

When I was thinking about what I could link it to, I looked at another chart on the bottom right of the slide.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yes, I can see it.

**Gergely Hollodi:** This slide is from Michelle Bagnall‚Äôs presentation, which she had before our presentation.

It‚Äôs a fantastic presentation; I recommend it to everyone.

She uses the same structural energy system, which, as I understand, was originally developed by Frank and Panol, based on Hippocratic medicine.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yes. And as I remember, I think she learned it directly from F. Kong.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Oh, that‚Äôs great‚ÄîI wish I had. 

**Elizabeth Ashley:** She did.
**Gergely Hollodi:** That's such, yeah, such a possibility. If you look at it, you can see that it's divided and you have all the quadrants‚Äîyou can see the phlegmatic, the melancholic, the sanguine, and the choleric, right?

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yeah.

**Gergely Hollodi:** And then you see the chart next to it.

I was looking at my notes and all these descriptions of these personalities and tried to put them in this grid. It didn't work. Because I tried to get some kind of an anchor for myself and came up with a trend‚Äîpeople really come up with very similar descriptions.

Is there a pattern I can follow? Let‚Äôs put it in a grid. So I looked at the four types of Hippocratic medicine. And although I examined it very thoroughly, I could only find that some, like the monoterpenes‚Äîyou see the yellow one in the bottom right quadrant‚Äîas well as the oxides, pretty much matched the descriptions people came up with. And then the description of Hippocratic medicine, but none of the others.

So I looked at Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine. They didn‚Äôt really match with any of these systems. So I decided to leave it by itself.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yeah. Sometimes you can‚Äôt reach the end of the line with something, right?

**Gergely Hollodi:** That‚Äôs what I said at the beginning of this conversation‚Äîthat it's not really explicit. Maybe after another 10 years of teaching, I might come up with a book of descriptions and findings, which could be very interesting.

However, let‚Äôs skip ahead if that‚Äôs all clear. I picked three chemical families that could be interesting: aldehydes, ketones, and phenylpropanoids.

So this is what we‚Äôre going through. If you look at the slide, you can see a picture of the molecule. For people familiar with chemistry, it‚Äôs just decoration.

I listed a few oils rich in aldehydes: lemon eucalyptus, which is obviously aldehyde-rich, lemongrass, Melissa, litsea, lemon verbena, citronella, and geranium. These are all oils rich in aldehydes, and they have very similar aromas.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Fragrance.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Yes, they do. I was just thinking‚Äîthey‚Äôre all lemony, fruity, vaguely floral, aren‚Äôt they?

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yes.

**Gergely Hollodi:** I try to make people look for patterns. It‚Äôs obviously not an explicit way to learn essential oils, but the nose knows, as we‚Äôll probably talk about later.

At the aromatherapy conference in Hungary, that was the slogan: ‚ÄúThe nose. Nose.‚Äù

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yeah.

**Gergely Hollodi:** All these essential oils, when you think about perfumery‚Äîfor example, Chanel No. 5 perfume, the first synthetic perfume that used an isolate called an aldehyde. It‚Äôs still the same because they use synthetic components, which was an aldehyde. Chanel No. 5 got its name because when Coco Chanel was presented with many samples, she knocked all off the table except number five, saying, ‚ÄúThis is the one I want.‚Äù

**Elizabeth Ashley:** The one made for the flapper girls in the 1920s?

**Gergely Hollodi:** Around that time, yes. A little bit, yeah.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I didn‚Äôt know it was called number five. That‚Äôs interesting.

**Gergely Hollodi:** They just knocked it off the table and called it number five because that was the one.

These are the essential oils I mainly use. Interestingly, for each group, people mostly voted for either female or male.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** There‚Äôs‚Äî

**Gergely Hollodi:** Only two options. It seems that all the aldehyde-rich oils are identified as female.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I would say they have a feminine energy.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Yeah.
**Gergely Hollodi:** Then some people‚ÄîI have to be right‚ÄîI can't just say that everybody voted for females. So that's why I put males in a smaller font size. If you look at the females, these were the words: sunshine, blueness, lemon, freedom, so clean, progressive, fresh, laminate.

These are all true. If you think about lemongrass‚Äî

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yeah.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Probably the majority of people who smell it would come up with those. It‚Äôs funny because you rarely think about a personality, but these were all the older ones. It's probably an urban, sporty woman who really knows what to do with their life, their profession, definitely.

But let‚Äôs say they are a little bit harsh‚Äînot soft, to put it lightly. Maybe that's not the right adjective. Active, independent, lots of kids. These are all words. It‚Äôs wonderful. So I think you can play with these ideas yourself: vain, mean, strong, jealous, like swimming, maximalist‚Äîwhat‚Äî

**Elizabeth Ashley:** A maximalist? What do we mean by that?

**Gergely Hollodi:** Someone who puts the pedal to the metal. Okay, everything I want‚ÄîI want to do everything perfectly. A perfectionist, very driven. Yeah. I was looking for a picture online, and I found this urban, sporty woman who looks like someone who knows what she does. You have to have very well-driven focus.

Then I found an illustration for the male, which was really funny because even if it‚Äôs a male, we have similar adjectives coming up.

We also have sporty ears, even for a male. One funny comment from one group was about this guy called Laumotto. If you‚Äôre not familiar with football‚Äîyou call it football; I call it soccer. In America, they call it soccer, right?

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Soccer, yeah.

**Gergely Hollodi:** So this is the castrated head coach.

I think it‚Äôs funny, and it‚Äôs just based on his history as a coach. But he is mostly a soccer player, autonomous, knows what he wants‚Äîsimilar to a female. Yeah, it is. But the majority of people voted female.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I would say it has a feminine energy.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Okay. When I was trying to link this to any system or find similarities with other work, I went through Valerie Ann Worwood‚Äôs *Fragrant Minds*.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yeah.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Their personalities‚Äîit's like... I think it‚Äôs a must-have book. Even though it‚Äôs old, it‚Äôs a must. She has this system called Aroma Regenera.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yeah.

**Gergely Hollodi:** I looked through it. Although she doesn't cover all oils, I checked what she thinks. It‚Äôs similar, right? Aroma Regenera gives real‚Äî

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Characters to the oils, doesn‚Äôt she?

**Gergely Hollodi:** Yes, but it‚Äôs a little different. She tries to give you tools to find yourself and put yourself in human traits. I looked at your book, and for example, lemon eucalyptus is rich in aldehydes.

It says the character is soundness, trust, vitality, harmonious‚Äîwhich I think isn‚Äôt far off from my characters.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** That‚Äôs right.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Weird, isn‚Äôt it? They probably never read Valerie Ann Worwood‚Äôs book.

**Credits:** Another‚Äî

**Gergely Hollodi:** It‚Äôs not something you read casually.

Then there‚Äôs the predisposition and uses. She says positive attributes are stimulant, concentration, enthusiastic, uplifting, expressiveness, freedom again. Very similar in one way for what you want to use the oils for‚Äîto elicit feelings from people.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yeah.

**Gergely Hollodi:** So that‚Äôs why we use these oils, and I think it‚Äôs an interesting finding. What do you think?

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I think it‚Äôs fascinating. I love Valerie‚Äôs work, and it‚Äôs one of my starting points when I‚Äôm looking at an oil‚Äôs character. But as you say, that character probably comes from the predominant chemicals creating it.

So it‚Äôs really interesting to see them laid out this way.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Yeah. Besides, I also list the main therapeutic properties. Obviously, phenylpropanoids are strong antivirals, nervous system additives, anti-inflammatory‚Äîbut they‚Äôre also skin irritants, as we know.

The majority of them.

And looking back, they‚Äôre strong and jealous at times. They know what they want, muscular, whatever.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** It‚Äôs interesting, isn‚Äôt it? Because if you have your oils for quite a long time, one of the first things my mom always says when she picks up my oils is, ‚ÄúThe aldehydes have gone out of that.‚Äù She can smell that the brightness has gone‚Äîthat it‚Äôs started to decay. It‚Äôs the brightness that goes away as the oil deteriorates. 

**Gergely Hollodi:** Okay. Then we have ketones. I‚Äôm not really friends with this group, let‚Äôs say.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Now? I like a good ketone.

**Gergely Hollodi:** I know. I listen to you so many times.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I‚Äôm‚Äî

**Gergely Hollodi:** Boring, and I should. I just put alt to John, which is one example of ketone-rich essential oils that I use.

It‚Äôs interesting because even though they all have ketones, they sometimes are predominantly different from each other.

Like spearmint, caraway, peppermint, eucalyptus‚Äîwhich has either cryptone or piperitone chemotypes. There are many chemotypes as well. Wormwood, obviously toyon, Spanish sage, rosemary (chemotype camphor and bourbon), which are both ketones, and Spanish lavender.

These oils are either full of ketones or have a very high percentage of ketones. People came up with the idea that this is a male group.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I‚Äôd say so.

**Gergely Hollodi:** In fact, for whatever reason, people pulled ketones many times. I don‚Äôt know why, but that‚Äôs how it happened.

I probably know ketones the best. You can see a sailor here, which probably isn‚Äôt the best picture, but it‚Äôs something I tried to find.

Generally, what people shared is the keyword Mediterranean.

I didn‚Äôt highlight it in bold, but it‚Äôs Mediterranean and is very much associated with fishermen, chefs, fishy foods.

Many people came up with the idea of a galley slave, soldier, fighter, even Terminator‚ÄîArnold Schwarzenegger, the film.

So that type. But on the other side, it‚Äôs like a wise, fair, fiery, charming person.

Most people said that their first impression was harsh.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yeah, it is harsh.

**Gergely Hollodi:** And the thing‚Äî

**Elizabeth Ashley:** That jumps out at me is metallic. That‚Äôs always what comes to me when I use it.

**Gergely Hollodi:** And metallic.

**Gergely Hollodi:** I think the only thing we were first talking about‚Äîmy talk with you‚Äîand then we were describing, and you helped me find this ‚Äúmetallic‚Äù sensation. It‚Äôs really like that in Hungarian‚Äîthey translate it as ‚Äúmetallic.‚Äù You feel it on your palms, right?

And this is interesting because it‚Äôs about your senses. People use head, throat, and ketones are actually very good mucolytics, right? That‚Äôs associated with your throat and possibly your head.

When they talk about Gaelic‚Äîsorry, Gaelic‚Äîthat corresponds for me with obsolete and the galley slave. It‚Äôs just a tale people make up; they really create this person. The majority voted it male. We also had a female correspondence, which was very surprising, Gergely‚Äîpeople used the same words as Italian mama.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I do. Yeah. She‚Äôs big and strong and rules the roost.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Everyone knows ‚Äúmom,‚Äù right? You are dad. Everyone knows where mom is. Oh my goodness, yes. That kind of personality is strong‚Äîa strong attribute.

Yes, but it was also said to be difficult to absorb at first, which sometimes they shared for males as well. But once you shave off the coarseness‚Äîafter a couple of minutes‚Äîthe oils become milder and gentler.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** They dry down a bit, don‚Äôt they?

**Gergely Hollodi:** Yes, it‚Äôs interesting how they describe this person. In general, the ketones‚Äîwhen you look at Aroma Regenera, I picked rosemary from her book. It‚Äôs vigorous, strengthening, restorative, centering. If you go back, it‚Äôs not far from what they found‚Äîjust synonyms.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yeah.

**Gergely Hollodi:** But rosemary is spiteful and bossy.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** You don‚Äôt like rosemary.

**Gergely Hollodi:** No. I like rosemary. I actually love rosemary.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Everybody keeps saying to me, ‚ÄúI would like that one,‚Äù but no, I don‚Äôt trust rosemary as far as I could throw her.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Oh, poor rosemary.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Never use.

**Gergely Hollodi:** When I was gathering these slides, Shakespeare came into my mind. Also, rosemary is called ‚Äúthe Jew of the sea,‚Äù right?

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yes. Which is funny again.

**Gergely Hollodi:** People don‚Äôt read Shakespeare very much. From these groups, they still came up with this Mediterranean seaside kind of pi.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Definitely. It smells like sea air, doesn‚Äôt it?

**Gergely Hollodi:** When you look at the positive attributes, it‚Äôs energy, confidence, structure, concentration, stabilization again.

If you go back, many of these words, and many of the attributes, they associated with these personalities and the therapeutic properties‚Äîstrong mucolytics, wound healing, especially like rosemary, bergamot, for example, calming to the center, nervous system active, and promoting skin tissue regeneration.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yeah.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Like a good old Italian mama who, you know, when you have mama‚Äôs‚Äî

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Tomato sauce takes‚Äî

**Gergely Hollodi:** Care of you. Okay. Then the last one is actually the phenylpropanoids. I use these oils, and this is a very particular group because if you go back to the ketones and aldehydes‚Äînot the aldehydes probably‚Äîbut the ketones are different.

Phenylpropanoids are similar to aldehydes in terms of their distinct smell, right?

**Credits:** Yeah.

**Gergely Hollodi:** If you smell phenylpropanoids, it‚Äôs hard for people to differentiate them from star anis. That‚Äôs why a lot of adulterated oils are on the market.

Anis, for example, is the real one, right? Yep. And star anis is in the same botanical family. It has essential oils in the seeds.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yes.

**Gergely Hollodi:** They yield very little oil.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** No.

**Gergely Hollodi:** So it‚Äôs very expensive.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** It is.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Whereas star anis, which you find in China, is the same. You just find it everywhere.
**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yeah. It‚Äôs very rich in oil as well, isn‚Äôt it?

**Gergely Hollodi:** Yes, it‚Äôs very rich in oils and has a very similar chemical composition. I always talk about it in chemistry class. Anis is supposed to be very expensive.

Star anise is a very cheap oil, so it‚Äôs easy for an average customer to not know‚Äî

**Elizabeth Ashley:** No.

**Gergely Hollodi:** ‚Äîif it‚Äôs star anise or anis.

Anyways, then we had sweet basil, sweet fennel, tarragon, cinnamon bark. I‚Äôm not going through all the chemical components by themselves; I‚Äôm talking about groups.

They‚Äôre represented and pretty much smell very similar.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** They do.

**Gergely Hollodi:** They came up as male. This was interesting because, and then you see the picture‚Äîit probably doesn‚Äôt truly represent what they came up with, but you can see the character.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yeah, yeah.

**Gergely Hollodi:** They usually came up with an older person‚Äîlike an uncle or granddad‚Äîand professions like a pharmacist.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Very ordered.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Think about family. That‚Äôs why I say it‚Äôs not an explicit thing I‚Äôm talking about now.

Our memories influence what we think about an essential oil.

Often, I think about cough syrup from when I was a kid because it had thyme.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yes. I hate‚Äî

**Gergely Hollodi:** It now. I like thyme. We became friends. Originally, I didn‚Äôt like it. Still don‚Äôt like it.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** No, I don‚Äôt really like medicine.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Yeah. Even though I know it‚Äôs excellent for digestive problems and is antispasmodic.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Edema.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Edema. So many applications, therapeutic properties.

Then we had an interesting reverence for black clove.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Like a wise man, like an Aryan, isn‚Äôt it?

**Gergely Hollodi:** Exactly. Like a pharmacist.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Moonshine. Funnily enough, that picture could describe my late stepdad‚Äîeven down to making moonshine.

I‚Äôm not sure it was moonshine, but some very dodgy things came out of it still. That picture almost looks like him.

**Gergely Hollodi:** One group I can hardly tell you about‚Äîit was about a Czech doctor who had a lover from the CREs who was assassinated. He came underground, planted an apricot tree on top of her, and made brandy or moonshine from the apricots.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** So am I right in remembering this group is what basil falls into?

**Gergely Hollodi:** Sweet basil.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** That‚Äôs almost exactly the traditional Italian legend about basil. A girl had a lover, the brothers didn‚Äôt like him, so they killed him and chopped off his head. She buried his head in a pot of basil. The basil grew very healthily on top of his head. That‚Äôs really almost the same.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Horror story.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Vile and‚Äî

**Gergely Hollodi:** Stories, yeah.

Some people even came up with constellations‚Äîlike Virgo.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yeah.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Anyway.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** You know what I said about my stepdad? He‚Äôs a Virgo. That‚Äôs a perfect description.

**Gergely Hollodi:** What we‚Äôre talking about isn‚Äôt explicitly academic, but it‚Äôs very interesting. Sometimes people couldn‚Äôt decide if a personality was male or female.

On this slide, we called it ambivalence. The personality behind the phenylpropanoid-rich oils was divided, irritating, moist, and often many-headed.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I have no idea what that word means.

**Gergely Hollodi:** It‚Äôs something related to sexual activity or orgy.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I say old man. Maybe it comes from ‚Äúban.‚Äù

**Gergely Hollodi:** An ambivalent personality isn‚Äôt necessarily positive or negative, or both‚Äîyou can‚Äôt say neutral or decide. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called ambivalent. People with ambivalent personalities are changing.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yeah.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Corresponding to Aroma Regenera, I picked sweet fennel‚Äîclearing, resolute, enlightened‚Äîwhich corresponds well with being orderly, like a librarian, educated.

Clearing. Enlightened. These are my thoughts. Positive attributes: fortitude, clarity, perseverance, reliant, confident, assertive‚Äîwhich can be like a pharmacist or someone from the Vatican, with assertiveness in how they view the world.

When talking about Aroma Regenera and my findings, I also noted the therapeutic properties of phenylpropanoids as a group: strong antibacterials, antiseptics, immune stimulants, nervous system stimulants, and anti-inflammatory agents.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yeah, definitely.

**Gergely Hollodi:** I think you get the gist. I don‚Äôt want to detail the others because I encourage everyone to play this game and develop their own lexicon or descriptions.

For example, the majority of people said George Clooney was a personality.

**Credits:** Wow.

**Gergely Hollodi:** It‚Äôs amazing‚Äîmore than three groups actually came up with the same name, George Clooney.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Who‚Äôs the lady at the bottom?

**Gergely Hollodi:** The woman from *Game of Thrones*.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Oh yes, I can see her now.

**Gergely Hollodi:** If anyone‚Äôs interested, they‚Äôre always welcome to contact me. I can share more findings. It‚Äôs fun.

When you look through the chemistry lens differently, chemistry can be fun.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I could definitely understand chemistry better that way.

**Gergely Hollodi:** It‚Äôs not explicit, but it‚Äôs fun. I encourage everyone to do the same. Hopefully, I might write a novel from these stories.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Brilliant. So we‚Äôve got your email address, and I‚Äôm sure people want to know your plans for next year. I‚Äôm guessing it involves a rather large conference in September?

**Gergely Hollodi:** Yes. Last year, there was an aromatherapy conference in Budapest. In 2019, we‚Äôre organizing another called the Drops Conference‚Äîprobably going to be called Budapest Drops. We‚Äôre applying to the city to use the name and help people get familiar with Hungary.

You were here last year, and it was wonderful. You spoke and did a workshop, which was amazing. People loved your presentations. The 2019 conference will have amazing people from around the world, who have already accepted my invitation, like Rhiannon, Louis, Madeline, Jade Shutes, Debbie Aby from Australia. She even promised to bring a kangaroo or koala outfit and chair out eucalyptus leaves.

**Credits:** Oh, what a great idea!

**Gergely Hollodi:** Yes, we‚Äôll have workshops and more. It‚Äôs a big project after this summit.

I also want to thank your daughter, Amy.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Oh.

**Gergely Hollodi:** She helped a lot putting this conference together.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** She did. And you and I, this is our job, but Amy actually saves lives for a living. For her to come and do this as well is such a boost. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll appreciate you saying that, Gergely. So thank you.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Also, I want to say thanks and gratitude to Jade Shutes. I learned aromatherapy originally from her, and we became friends. She‚Äôs been a big inspiration.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Thank you for the course as well, Jade.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Yes, thanks for the course, Jade and Amy, from the New York Institute of Aromatherapy.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yes.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Beautiful. These are my findings. If anyone wants to contact me, please do.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Gergely, I loved it. It was worth the wait.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Thank you. It was interesting. You can start playing tomorrow.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Not yet. Something else is happening in the next couple of days.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Yes. They can start playing with others later if they want.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I‚Äôm definitely going to have a go. Chemistry is my weakness, so any way in is good for me.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Alice in Wonderland, looking through the glass.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** You‚Äôre right, darling. Thank you very much. Say goodbye.

**Gergely Hollodi:** Okay. Goodbye everyone.
