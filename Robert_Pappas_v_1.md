**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
Hello, and welcome to the *Beyond the Essential Oil Recipe Summit*. I'm Elizabeth Ashley, The Secret Healer, and today—get ready to like and share—because in his car, we have Dr. Robert Pappas grabbing a moment while he is on a road trip. Hello, Dr. Pappas!

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Hello, Elizabeth Ashley. Thank you for having me.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
Not at all! It's great that you've managed to squeeze us in. Thank you so much—I'm excited to interview you. I'm sure there is nobody who doesn't know who you are, but tell us a little bit about your background—where you come from.

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
I got my PhD in Chemistry in 1998 from the University of Tennessee. Then I went into teaching for a little bit—taught high school, taught college. Eventually I was found by a headhunting company to work for a U.S. company involved in essential oils and fragrance.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
Oh, I didn’t know that! That’s exciting.

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Yeah, I was their senior chemist and perfumer for a couple of years. I developed a bunch of fragrance formulas for them, and did all their quality control—on both essential oils and raw materials. That’s where I really learned the industry and cut my teeth.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
How long were you there?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Two years.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
Brilliant. That must have been a steep learning curve.

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Absolutely. When you’re doing all the QC and fragrance duplication, you’re on a crash course. I developed about 2,000 fragrance formulas in two years.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
Did you really? Gosh, amazing. So, forgive me—are you an aromatherapist? People ask me that too and I say, yes, but that’s not what I do...

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
No, I'm not an aromatherapist. I’m an essential oil chemist. After I left that company in ’98, I went out on my own and have been ever since. My passion isn’t in synthetic fragrance development—it’s in natural fragrance and essential oil analysis.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
So you don’t recommend oils to people?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
No, I try to keep my focus on chemistry. I know what aromatherapy entails and what oils are used for, but I don’t get into recommending.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
Let’s talk about your work with Essential Oil University. Where did that passion for analysis and adulteration detection come from?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
I think it’s just part of being a scientist. I love real oils—and when I see people selling synthetic fragrances as “100% pure therapeutic grade essential oils,” it’s personal to me. It creates an unfair advantage and misleads people. So I try to level the playing field by exposing those companies.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
Are you still involved with Essential Oil University?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Yes, absolutely.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
Didn’t you make the EOU database free about six months ago?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Yes—and it’s still free. I added advertising on the site to cover costs. I don’t control what ads show up, but that allows people to access it without barriers.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
It’s a tremendous resource—thank you for doing that.

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
You're welcome.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
You also consult on blending, don’t you? What else do companies bring you in for?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Analytical work and formulation. For example, natural blends for deodorants—I’ve done a lot of work for companies like Switch Natural. Natural fragrance is in demand—for toothpaste, candy, candles...

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
I’m fascinated—how do you approach blending if you’re not an aromatherapist? Do you use top, middle, base note structures?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
That’s an old-school model. I focus on the desired properties *and* how the blend smells. Odor is a priority. I want it to smell good *and* be effective. That’s especially challenging in all-natural perfumery because the palette is more limited than synthetics.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
Do you use synthetics too?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
I can, but I prefer all-natural. Sometimes clients want synthetics, like in a can-based product where naturalness isn't important. But my passion is for great-smelling natural blends.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
How many oils go into a blend?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
It varies—sometimes 5–6, sometimes 30–40. Depends on the product and the goal.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
And how long does it take?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Some blends are quick if the client knows what they want. Others take longer if I’m creating from scratch.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
So where did your fascination with botanical extracts come from? I got excited when I found out I could buy beta-caryophyllene from you!

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
It started with cannabis extracts and the CBD boom. People began paying attention to terpenes in cannabis. MLMs picked up Copaiba balsam for its beta-caryophyllene content. I thought: why not offer 99% pure beta-caryophyllene?

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
How do you isolate it?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Fractional vacuum distillation—from whole essential oils. I just started a terpene division of EOU, actually.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
That’s exciting! Is it on the main database?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
No—it’s a separate site, but linked from [www.essentialoil.university](https://www.essentialoil.university). It’ll have the world’s largest selection of natural terpene isolates, with data like density, refractive index, optical rotation, boiling point...

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
Are you measuring those yourself?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Yes—all in our lab.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
And these terpenes come from essential oils?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Correct. We’re also recreating cannabis strain profiles using essential oil–derived terpenes. Cannabis EO yields are too low to be practical, so we rebuild profiles from other sources.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
It’s a beautiful oil though—one of my favorites.

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Yes, but very expensive.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
You’re also the reason I wrote my cannabis book, you know. A whole year of my life lost—but in a good way!

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
It’s a great book—I enjoyed it.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
Thank you. Are other isolates popular?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Yes—beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, myrcene, the pinenes. We have about 30 up now, aiming for 100.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
How fast are you building this?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Fast—what’s there now is two weeks of work.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
And the actual extracts—can we buy those?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Beta-caryophyllene is up. Boswellic acids not yet. Vital oils aren’t there yet—still focusing on the terpene division.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
Can people use them in creams or just vaping?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Both. Vaping is the biggest current use—adding strain profiles back into cannabinoid extracts for the “entourage effect.” But yes, you can use them in creams or aromatherapy products.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
Do you list the properties?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Each isolate entry includes a “bioactivity” section. For example, beta-caryophyllene = anti-inflammatory.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
And do you sell them wholesale?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Yes. I handle the terpene division sales directly through EOU.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
Where can people find your oils?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
My essential oil blends are produced only by The Perfumery—my brother’s company. I trust him to maintain quality. He distributes in bulk to wholesalers.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
And your chemistry course—is that still available?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Yes! The entire *Chemistry of Essential Oils* course is free on YouTube—search “EO Doctor.” It was originally taught at Indiana University.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
Can people get the full kit?

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Yes—it includes 49 isolates and EOs for odor ID, a laminated booklet, tests, and a certificate if you complete it in 12 weeks. Kits are available through the [essentialoils.org](https://essentialoils.org) shop.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
Fantastic. I didn’t know you came from a fragrance background.

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Yes—it’s the best foundation for detecting adulteration. You can often smell it, but of course you need GC evidence for proof.

**Elizabeth Ashley:**  
Thank you so much, Dr. P. I’ve loved this. Enjoy the rest of your road trip—and say thank you to your family for letting us borrow you!

**Dr. Robert Pappas:**  
Thank you, Elizabeth Ashley. Great to see you!
