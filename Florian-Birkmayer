## Full Transcript

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Hello and welcome to the Beyond the Essential Oil Recipe Summit. I'm Elizabeth Ashley, the Secret Healer, and if you're watching on Facebook Live, get ready to like and share right now because we are joined by the lovely Dr. Florian Birkmayer. Hello, Florian.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Elizabeth.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I'm so pleased to see you here, and if anybody doesn't know, this lecture is on my bucket list. I've always wanted to hear Florian speak, so this is a big moment for me. If there is anybody out there who doesn't know who you are, please tell us a bit about your background.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Thank you, Elizabeth. I'm originally from Austria. I've lived in the US for 30 years. My current work with my wife, Cathy Skipper, is really the culmination of many strands in my life. 

I went to medical school many years ago and felt very called to psychiatry because, to me, the origin of a lot of physical problems and diseases is really in the psyche and the unconscious. I also felt that in theory, psychiatry could be very holistic. I used to say you could treat from the molecule to the community, and I still believe that. The reality, though, is that psychiatry has become just a pill-pushing business. I found that very frustrating because it feels stuck on the symptom level.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** "I can't sleep, here's a sleeping pill," "I have anxiety, here's an anxiety pill." It became really superficial for me, and I was hungry for something else.

On the aromatherapy side, since I was a kid in Austria, my grandfather once bought one of the first essential oil blends called JHP in the seventies, so we would smell that. Austrians do a lot of sauna like Scandinavians, and he was using aromas and oils there.

In medical school, I used various oils to help me study, like basil and citrus oils. But in psychiatry, because I felt the scientific basis was thin, and they had to pretend they were more scientific than they are, discussions about alternative treatments, especially in psychiatry, were frowned upon.

So I didn't share much with my colleagues while I was in training and when I was a professor at the University of New Mexico, but I was using aromatherapy for myself—a sleep oil blend—and many healthcare workers have so much stress they can't sleep themselves. I started sharing it with nurses and colleagues, and even though we were entrenched in conventional psychiatry, word spread. Nurses would whisper, "Hey, can I have some of that sleep oil? It's amazing."

**Elizabeth Ashley:** How it happens once the word gets out!

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Exactly. Even us so-called keepers of the faith in conventional psychiatry were hungry for something else.

The third strand I want to mention is Carl Jung. I'd known about Jung for probably 35 years, but only began to understand him deeply in the last 10 years. Interestingly, he visited New Mexico in 1925.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Oh really? Where?

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** There's a famous story where he meets a Native American who says, "What's wrong with you Westerners? You think with this," meaning the head, "We think with this," meaning the heart.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** And I think that's true.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** So the third strand is really holism—not as an intellectual exercise, but as something you live from the heart. So we've got Jung, aromatherapy, and psychiatry, which culminate in who I am today.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Fascinating blend. To an outsider, aromatherapy and psychiatry might seem very different, but we see how they mesh. How do you use essential oils then?

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** You're right; on the surface, they seem very different. I feel like I don't want to use the word aromatherapy anymore because it often feels cosmetic.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** It's lost its art, hasn't it?

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Yes. We work with aromas, essential oils, and hydrosols as living souls of the plant—not just products or tools. That changes your relationship with them. Like with a human friend, you have many relationships and aspects to that relationship, and that's how I feel about oils.

I've worked with Aka for years and felt their beauty, their cephalic properties, and recently I felt a regal, warrior-like presence—a force for light in the world.

You can work with oils for years and keep discovering. It's not just what's in the book, like lavender for anxiety; it's about the holistic relationship.

Another core principle is that it's not about symptom relief—that's too superficial. The oils are allies on our life journey, allowing us to dig deep into our psyche and learn.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Currently, it's easy to feel overwhelmed and hopeless, a "thought virus" that disempowers us.

Jung's concept of the wounded healer means we must work on ourselves to help others. Enlightenment comes not from seeking more light but confronting our inner darkness fearlessly.

I work through my unconscious with the oils, with Cathy, and in our classes, which heals the world.

If the wounded healer ignores their wounds, they become a wounded wounder. We see this when health professionals burn out and act against healing.

Working on ourselves is the antidote to futility, and that's how the light spreads.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Beautiful. How do we build a deeper relationship with plant allies?

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Better to know 3-5 oils deeply than superficial knowledge of many. I mostly just smell the oils now and anoint myself simply—put a drop on temples, heart, or other points.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** What's that for?

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** That, to me, is just an easy way to explain to people how to anoint. The nine-point anoint rolls off the tongue, and when you put oils here and on your pulses, they enter the bloodstream extremely quickly. Very quickly. On a practical level, when you put a drop here, you smell it.

The most important thing about anointing is to set an intention—a commitment. Intentionality is really important when working with oils.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I think people find it very difficult to know where to start with intention. What sort of questions would we ask ourselves to decide that?

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** It helps to get into routines. Especially with clients, but I anoint myself most mornings. The image in my head is like a samurai putting on armor—putting on your investments. The ritual, including anointing, is a way for the conscious and unconscious to communicate.

You can’t send the unconscious an email or text message; it’s its own being and talks to us indirectly. Ritual is how the conscious and unconscious say, “Here we are. Let’s work together.”

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Turn up together, yeah.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** You could start with an intention like, “Every morning, I want to be a force or presence for healing in the world today.”

For inward work, I might do that each morning and then do gratitude in the evening—cleansing yourself with the scent of the oil, putting a drop in your hand and saying, “Thank you for this day, no matter what happened.”

Gratitude practice every evening is really good.

For more specific work, intention should be general awareness and openness—not too ego-driven, specific, or demanding, but more like an invitation.

If you feel drawn to an oil—say, you smell it unexpectedly—then you can smell it and ask yourself, “What am I supposed to receive? What am I supposed to learn right now?”

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** In deeper work, like in classes with Kathy, we use specific oils that are good at plumbing the depths of the unconscious. I say, “I am ready to receive what my unconscious is trying to tell me.”

“Unconscious” here is from my Jungian psychological background, but it’s roughly the same as “soul,” the repository of wisdom connecting us all.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** How does that relate to the subconscious? Different or the same?

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Different people use terms differently. The subconscious often means personal unconscious—stuff you forgot, like what you had for breakfast.

The unconscious includes personal parts you haven’t discovered yet and connects psychically to the collective unconscious.

Some people doubt the unconscious exists, but many of my clients realize its power when confronted with addiction.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I see that. Something behind the surface drives behavior.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Exactly. Part of the ego mind says, “I shouldn’t do this,” but the unconscious drive, the addiction, makes them do it anyway.

There’s a quote: “The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing us he doesn’t exist.” That’s like the unconscious.

When we confront behaviors we don’t want but can’t stop, we taste that power.

We aim to turn that power from self-destructive to ally.

Oils help by bringing hidden aspects up, preserving consciousness like a searchlight so we don’t get lost.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Like a thread back.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Exactly.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** When I wrote my cannabis book, I spent a year on one plant. As you say, you can get lost in the labyrinth.

I heard you talk about “molecules of connectedness,” related to the collective unconscious. Can you tell me more?

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Yes. That’s one of my favorite themes.

Psychiatrically, most people I work with, no matter their label, have trauma or PTSD underneath.

Trauma is a sense of being cut off—from self, meaning, loved ones, the world.

Since before medical school, I wondered why we have dopamine as a neurotransmitter. Plants have molecules like dopamine and serotonin—inside us and aromatic molecules—to communicate with us.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Plants have dopamine?

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Yes.

Why do we have a sense of smell? Millions of years ago, it wasn’t to smell perfume but for survival.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** A survival mechanism.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** More than that.

Like computers connected by wifi, aromatic molecules connect plants and us through the air.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** That’s funny. I’m writing about how plants signal others—secret signaling systems.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** That’s why we have smell.

Spirit in many traditions equals breath.

We inhale at birth, exhale at death.

We breathe the same air as plants.

This air is the medium of the collective unconscious.

Molecules travel through it, reconnecting us when trauma cuts us off.

Clinically, spiritually, philosophically, these “molecules of connectedness” remind us we’re not alone, helping us when hurt or stuck.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** When using oils properly, it feels like they guide you—like sweet basil telling you to get out of your head.

Like friends with different messages.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Exactly.

A single oil can teach many things.

I carry a medicine bag with small oils around my neck.

Sandalwood was my ally for years.

Now the oils I carry have changed but remain like good friends.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Like me with Menard oil. Native Americans say it brings the people you need.

My garden is full of Menard, and I see all the people I need.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Plants grow where they’re called.

Like humans, we’re called.

Plants come into our lives at just the right time.

I first smelled Palo Santo and felt like meeting an old friend.

We can have deep relationships with plants.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Definitely.

You said addiction is always underpinned by PTSD and trauma?

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Without knowing specifics, yes.

We all have patterns to soothe or numb ourselves.

Jung said the unconscious never gives us more than we can handle.

But these unconscious patterns—like addiction—can kill us.

If we avoid what the unconscious or soul asks, life gives many chances but then says “game over.”

There’s a story where a client refused to go into his depths, was obsessed with mountain climbing, and died in an accident.

Jung called that “spiritual suicide.”

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I think that’s true for physical disease as well.
**Elizabeth Ashley:** Pho. Yeah. Had enough. Yeah. I do think that about physical disease generally as well.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Yeah. I think that you can try and heal the symptom, but if you don't do the work inside, it'll come back in a different way.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Absolutely, especially chronic diseases, where symptoms are like whack-a-mole. That’s often trauma, and it doesn’t have to be personal trauma. It could be historical trauma, family trauma, or secrets kept. Kathy is doing a lot of work on that right now and is better equipped to talk about it.

If we’re willing to face what our unconscious, our soul, is asking us with the help of oils, I think that’s the best use of our short time in this human form.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** One thing I like about Jung is that when asked what is the best you can hope for, Freud said, "Just to be normally miserable like everyone else." Western medicine defines health negatively—as absence of disease.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Patients often don’t feel fine, though.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** You, on the other hand, had a positive definition of health: life as a continuous opportunity to evolve. He called that individuation—the practical form being personal myth, where you use life to discover who you really are and live the unique life only you can live.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Tell us more about individuation. What’s involved day to day? Can we pause recording for a second?

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Sure.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I wonder if you could talk more about individuation? I see it written a lot and study Jungian psychology, but don’t feel it fully in my heart.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Thank you. That’s important because one reason the world is in crisis is the ego—our limited self-identity—has taken over and lost relationship with everything around us.

There’s individualism, worshipping the ego, versus individuation, which means something very different.

The ego is the small “self” — who we think we are. Jung’s “Self” with a capital S is like the world soul, the atman in Sanskrit.

Who we think we are is a small part of a larger being connected like a tree in a forest.

Individuation is the journey from ego (small self) to Self (capital S).

Much of the Self is unconscious—parts we forgot or haven’t discovered, including the collective unconscious.

This journey is lifelong growth, not just intellectual but experiential.

As Jung said, “We become enlightened not by seeking more light, but by fearlessly confronting the darkness inside.”

Oils are great allies for this because aromas retrieve and reveal what’s within us to change.

A key concept is projection: parts of ourselves we don’t know or like we project onto others.

Strong emotional reactions are unconscious communication.

We can question why we feel a certain way and learn from it.

Jung said the world hangs by a thin thread—the human psyche—and healing the world begins with healing our inner responses.

Individuation offers that opportunity, and oils help facilitate it.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I think about the microcosm and macrocosm—I used to say those long words as a kid.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Exactly. Old alchemical drawings show the human as microcosm of the macrocosm.

Alchemy described psyche changes and invented hydrosols and essential oils.

We’ve split alchemy apart, but aromatherapy reunites it.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Yes.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Like the alchemists did.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** You made a good point about needing a new word for aromatherapy.

The world learns aromatherapy left-brain, reading internet pages, not sitting with oils or letting the unconscious explore.

You can’t do it left-brain only.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** It becomes superficial.

Marge Clarke, one of your guests, mentioned some oils are so powerful they can “blow you open” if you’re not ready or guided.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** How do you use essential oils to heal trauma?

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** You have to be willing to grow.

I like aromatic allies for grounding, especially tree and flower oils—balancing vertical integration and lovingness.

One blend I used often is Palo Santo, a South American tree oil, combined with Melissa.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Oh, beautiful. I wouldn’t have thought to put those two together.
**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Yeah, and it might sound weird on paper.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Sounds nice.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** It started with clients in the office who would go into their trauma and their eyes would flicker—they were reliving the trauma and anguished.

Palo Santo has beautiful vertical integration—grounding from root through crown to the divine. It’s made from trees dead for 20 years, products of death and decay, yet contains 85% limonene—a light, solar molecule symbolizing new light rising from darkness.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** That’s beautiful.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** When in trauma’s darkness, Palo Santo is an ally reminding us the seed of the next dawn lies at the darkest hour.

Melissa is good for the heart—when trauma triggers fast heartbeat and breathing, Melissa slows everything so you can return to your body and breathe.

This combination grounds people and allows presence with symptoms instead of covering them up.

Jung said symptoms are not enemies but messages from the unconscious; emotional symptoms are physical.

Once grounded, one can use oils to accelerate alchemical stages of soul growth.

Have you ever felt angry?

**Elizabeth Ashley:** No, I’m the most tranquil person I know. I’m always angry, Florian.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Anger, frustration, rage—heated emotions—are like turning up internal heat.

Like distilling oil, first you need heat to start transformation.

Instead of suppressing anger, we must journey through it to heal.

Heating oils like oregano or winter savory physically warm the body to “psychically sweat out” tension.

Next comes tears of release—salutatio—the emotional flood.

Instead of covering symptoms, we walk alongside clients with oils as allies.

We want to empower people to learn and use these tools for life.

Though abstract at first, our approach is practical, lived, and effective.

In moments of chaos, I ask, what would Jung say? How can oils help me in this microcosm-macrocosm relationship?

Everything, even hardship, fuels growth.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Everything happens for a reason.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** I meditated in Bhutan where a spirit said, “Our obstacles are stepping stones.”

The spiritual path may be tall, but challenges become steps to grow.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Fascinating. What’s it like working with your wife?

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** I feel like the luckiest man alive to live and breathe what we both love.

Kathy is my twin flame—we met at the right time.

Our shared love of plants and each other is a joy to share with the world.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I feel lucky I don’t have to work with my husband!

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Every relationship is different.

I had to work on myself and confront my inner darkness before I was ready to meet my soulmate.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I was a sad weakling until my husband rescued me.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** And you are both lucky.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** You have plans for your school—tell us about online learning.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Live classes are intense, like drinking from a firehose.

Online classes let people learn at their own pace, from anywhere.

We send kits with oils so learners have what they need.

Students revisit classes for months or years; psychological growth is lifelong.

Our online school is [aromagnosis.com](https://aromagnosis.com) (“gnosis” means direct perception).

**Elizabeth Ashley:** I love that word!

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Classes include foundational aromatherapy and medicine of the soul, hydrosol making, plant communication, and alchemy of menopause.

We ensure oils used have the energetic qualities needed for deep work.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** You mentioned “beita”—what is that?

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Beita is Latin for “greenness.”

It describes oils that provoke intense memory, synesthesia, or emotional reaction.

Many commercial oils lack this because of growing and distillation methods.

We started selling a handful of carefully chosen oils and hydrosols as practical tools.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Flat oils are frustrating!

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Exactly.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** When working with trauma, how do you start? Psychologically or physically?

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Grounding for ourselves as healers is essential.

A neurologist said, “Don’t just do something, sit there.”

We hold space and accompany clients gently, as stages vary.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Like Avara, Buddha of compassion.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Yes, holding space is healing.

Biomedical meds often treat doctor anxiety, not patients.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** What advice for trauma workers?

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Honor the client’s journey; let oils guide the way.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** My late dad said, “The first person to speak has lost.” Patients are like that, right?

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Yes. I met a horse therapist who said he carries three stones and only speaks thrice before listening.

Healing is witnessing the client’s microcosm-macrocosm journey and working on ourselves.

**Elizabeth Ashley:** Beautiful way to end. Next, I’ll interview Kathy and we recommend listening to Marge Clarke’s interview.

Thank you, Florian.

**Dr. Florian Birkmayer MD:** Thank you, Elizabeth. See you again.
